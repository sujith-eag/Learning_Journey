The `<strong>` tag is used when we want to indicate the importance, seriousness, or urgency of a word or section of content without changing the meaning of the content itself.

### Emphasis `<em>  </em>`
The `<em>` tag places stress emphasis on a particular piece of content in a way that changes the actual meaning of the content with verbal stress.

### Italic `<i>  </i>`
The `<i>` tag is used to convey a different mood or voice from the surrounding content. It’s often used with foreign words or idiomatic phrases, technical terms, ship names, thoughts, etc

### Bold `<b>  </b>`
The `<b>` tag draws attentions to word or section of content for utilitarian purposes without conveying extra importance, emphasis, alternate voice or mood, etc. It is the _least_ semantic of the HTML tags we’ve discussed in this post, and should only be used when no other tag is more appropriate.
