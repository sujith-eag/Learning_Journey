### Unordered Lists  `<ul>  <li> </li>  </ul>`       #02sep24 
Used when the order doesn't matter. each item in the list is represented by `<li>` which will be represented by a bullet point of circle, square or dot. The styles will be defined by CSS `line-style-type`


### Ordered Lists `<Ol>  <li> </li>  </ul>`
For creating a list of items where order and numbering does matter.
By default `<ol>` will assign numbers to each of the list items added.

Both can be listed inside the other as much as needed.
if a second list has to be nested inside the second item, then it should be inside it's `<li>  </li>`

```HTML
<ul>
  <li>first item</li>
  <li>
    second item
    <!-- Look, the closing </li> tag is not placed here! -->
    <ul>
      <li>second item first subitem</li>
      <li>
        second item second subitem
        <!-- Same for the second nested unordered list! -->
        <ul>
          <li>second item second subitem first sub-subitem</li>
          <li>second item second subitem second sub-subitem</li>
          <li>second item second subitem third sub-subitem</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <!-- Closing </li> tag for the li that
                  contains the third unordered list -->
      <li>second item third subitem</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Here is the closing </li> tag -->
  </li>
  <li>third item</li>
</ul>


- first item
- second item
    - second item first subitem
    - second item second subitem
        - second item second subitem first sub-subitem
        - second item second subitem second sub-subitem
        - second item second subitem third sub-subitem
    - second item third subitem
- third item
```

# Global Attributes
`reversed`  numbered from high to low
`start="4"` starts numbers from 4
`type`  `a` for lowercase `A` for uppercase
	  `i` for lower roman `I` for upper roman
		
```HTML
<ol start="4">        starts from 4
</ol>

<ol reversed>  </ol>
```

#### Value attribute
Used on individual `<li>` within an ordered list to change the value of the list.
```HTML
<ol>
  <li>Head north on N Halsted St</li>
  <li value="9">Turn right on W Diversey Pkwy</li>
  <li>Turn left on N Orchard St</li>
</ol>
```

### Description Lists

Another type of list is the description list. 
Description lists are used to outline multiple terms and their descriptions, as in a glossary, for example.

Creating a description list in HTML is accomplished using the description list block-level element, `<dl>`. 
Instead of using a `<li>` element to mark up list items, the description list requires two block-level elements: 
the description term element, `<dt>`, 
and the description element, `<dd>`.

`<dd>` element includes a left `margin` by default.
The definition term and the description that directly follows it correspond to one another; thus, the order of these elements is important.

```HTML
<dl>
  <dt>study</dt>
  <dd>The devotion of time and attention to acquiring knowledge on an academic subject, especially by means of books</dd>
  <dt>design</dt>
  <dd>A plan or drawing produced to show the look and function or workings of a building, garment, or other object before it is built or made</dd>
  <dd>Purpose, planning, or intention that exists or is thought to exist behind an action, fact, or material object</dd>
  <dt>business</dt>
  <dt>work</dt>
  <dd>A person's regular occupation, profession, or trade</dd>
</dl>
