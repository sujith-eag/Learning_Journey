## [Interactive elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#interactive_elements)

HTML offers a selection of elements that help to create interactive user interface objects.

|Element|Description|
|---|---|
|[`<details>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details)|Creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. A summary or label must be provided using the [`<summary>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary) element.|
|[`<dialog>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog)|Represents a dialog box or other interactive component, such as a dismissible alert, inspector, or subwindow.|
|[`<summary>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary)|Specifies a summary, caption, or legend for a details element's disclosure box. Clicking the `<summary>` element toggles the state of the parent [`<details>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) element open and closed.|

## [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#web_components)

Web Components is an HTML-related technology that makes it possible to, essentially, create and use custom elements as if it were regular HTML. In addition, you can create custom versions of standard HTML elements.

|Element|Description|
|---|---|
|[`<slot>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot)|Part of the [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) technology suite, this element is a placeholder inside a web component that you can fill with your own markup, which lets you create separate DOM trees and present them together.|
|[`<template>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template)|A mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a page is loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript.|
