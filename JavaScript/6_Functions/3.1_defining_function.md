There are **three ways** to define a function in JavaScript:

The most straight forward way is using the `function` keyword which can be used as a 
**Function Expressions** or **Function Declarations**.

Another is **Arrow Function** which is a compact syntax useful when passing one function as an argument to another function.

### 1. Function Expression

A **Function Expression** is when a function appears within the context of a larger expression or statement. The function itself is assigned to a variable, which can then be called later.  The name is optional.

As the function creation happens in the context of the assignment expression (to the right side of `=`), this is a _Function Expression_.

```js
const square = function(x) {
	return x * x;
};

console.log(square(12)); // 144
```
Function for `square` is defined as an expression and assigned to the variable `square`. It can be called later after the definition.

- A function starts with the `function` keyword, followed by a set of **parameters** inside parentheses `()`, and then a **body** inside curly braces `{}` which contains the statements to be executed when function is called.
- Functions can have **no parameters** or **multiple parameters**.
- The `return` keyword is used to return a value from the function. 
- If no `return` statement is provided, the function returns `undefined` by default.

Since the function is part of an expression, it cannot be used before it is defined, these functions do not exist until the expression that defines them are actually evaluated. In order to invoke a function, you must be able to refer to it, and you can’t refer to a function defined as an expression until it is assigned to a variable, so functions defined with expressions cannot be invoked before they are defined.

**Important Note**:  
- A **Function Expression** typically ends with a **semicolon** (`;`) since it's part of an assignment statement. But function declaration do not.

A Function Expression is created here as `function(…) {…}` inside the `=` assignment statement:  `let sayHi = …;`.
The semicolon `;` is recommended at the end of the statement, it’s not a part of the function syntax.
```js
let sayHi = function() {
// function body
}; // semicolon required
```

Example with no parameters:
```js
const makeNoise = function() {
	console.log("Ping!");
};
makeNoise(); 
// Ping!
```

___

Example with multiple parameters:
```js
const roundTo = function(n, step) {
	let remainder = n % step;
	return n - remainder + (remainder < step / 2 ? 0 : step);
};

console.log(roundTo(23, 10)); 
// 20
```
If the `remainder` is less than half of `step`, it rounds down; otherwise, it rounds up.

___

Function expressions can also be used as arguments to other functions:
```js
[3,2,1].sort( function(a,b){return a-b; } );
```

Sometimes they can be defined and immediately invoked:
```js
let tenSquared = (function(x){return x*x} (10));
```

Function expressions can include names, which is useful for recursion when function needs to refer to themselves.
```js
const f = function fact(x) { if (x <= 1) return 1; else return x*fact(x-1); };
```

#### Python Equivalent:
```python
def makeNoise():
    print("Ping!")

makeNoise()

def roundTo(n, step):
    remainder = n % step
    if remainder >= step / 2:
        return (n - remainder) + step
    return (n - remainder)

print(roundTo(23, 10)) # 20
```

### 2. Function Declaration

A **Function Declaration** is the classic way to define a function in JavaScript. 

It starts with the `function` keyword, followed by the **function name**, A comma separated **parameter names** within parentheses, and the **function body**  which are statements enclosed in curly braces.
  ```js
  function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...parameterN) {
    // body
  }
  ```

```js
function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
console.log(square(12)); // 144
```

```js
//function expression
let square = function(x) {
	return x * x;
};
```

```js
function area(radius) {
	return Math.PI * radius * radius;
}
```
  - A **Function Declaration** **does not require a semicolon** after it, because it's a complete statement by itself.
  - The **function name** must be valid (cannot start with a number, etc.).
  - The function is created when the script is **loaded** and is **hoisted** to the top of its scope. This means it can be called **before its actual declaration** in the code.

```js
// Print the name and value of each property of o.
function printprops(o) {
for(let p in o) {
console.log(`${p}: ${o[p]}\n`);
}
}
```

```js
// Compute the distance between Cartesian points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).

function distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
let dx = x2 - x1;
let dy = y2 - y1;
return Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);
}
```

```js
// A recursive function (one that calls itself) that computes factorials

function factorial(x) {
if (x <= 1) return 1;
return x * factorial(x-1);
}

// x! is the product of x and all positive integers less than it.
```

#### **Hoisting Behavior**:  
A function declaration creates a function object and assigns it to the specified name. The function declarations in any block of JavaScript code are processed before that code runs, and the function names are bound to the function objects throughout the block.

Function Declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, so they can be called before they are defined in the code. 

All of the functions declared in a block of JavaScript code will be defined throughout that block, and they will be defined before the JavaScript interpreter begins to execute any of the code in that block.

Function Expressions, on the other hand, are **not hoisted** and can only be called after they are defined.

```js
console.log("The future says: ", future());

function future() {
  return "You will never have flying cars";
}
```
In this example, the function `future()` can be called before it's defined because the function declaration is hoisted to the top.

  - **Function Declarations** are useful when you want your functions to be accessible throughout the entire scope.
  - **Function Expressions** are useful when you need to define functions **dynamically** (such as inside loops, conditionals, or callbacks).



#### Function Declarations and Scope

- A **Function Declaration** is **visible** throughout the **entire scope** it’s defined in (whether in a block, function, or global scope).
- If a function is declared within a block (e.g., inside `if` or `for` statements), it's only visible **inside that block**, not outside of it. So calling it from outside is not possible.

So better to declare a function using `function expression` outside a code block first, and reassign it inside the code block. This makes the function visible from outside also.

***Function Declaration Inside Code Blocks:***
```js
let age = 18;

let welcome;  // Declare the variable to hold the function

if (age < 18) {
  welcome = function() {
    alert("Hello");
  };
} else {
  welcome = function() {
    alert("Greetings");
  };
}

welcome(); // Outputs either "Hello" or "Greetings" based on the age
```

- **Alternative with Ternary Operator**:
```js
let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

let welcome = (age < 18)
  ? function() { alert("Hello"); }
  : function() { alert("Greetings"); };

welcome(); // Outputs based on age
```

### Key Differences Between Function Expressions and Function Declarations

| Feature       | **Function Declaration**                              | **Function Expression**                                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hoisting**  | Hoisted to the top, can be called before declaration. | Not hoisted, can only be called after definition.                          |
| **Syntax**    | `function name() {}`                                  | `let name = function() {}`                                                 |
| **Semicolon** | No semicolon required after function body.            | Semicolon is required after function expression.                           |
| **Use Case**  | Ideal for globally accessible functions.              | Ideal for dynamically defined functions or passing functions as arguments. |

- **Function Expressions** are functions assigned to variables and are only usable after their definition.
- **Function Declarations** are hoisted, meaning they can be used before the declaration in the code.
- Choose **Function Declarations** for global accessibility and **Function Expressions** for dynamic or localized functions.
