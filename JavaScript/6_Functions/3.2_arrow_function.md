Arrow functions are a concise syntax, instead of `function` key word it uses an arrow  `=>` to define a function. They offer several advantages, such as more concise syntax and different behavior for `this` keyword.

The arrow comes after the parameters and is followed by the function's body. It express something like,  "this input produces this result".
There is no need for a function name.

```js
let func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) => expression;
```
This defines a function `func` that takes parameters `arg1, arg2, ..., argN`, and evaluates the given `expression`.

If the body of the function is a single return statement, you can omit the `return` keyword, the `semicolon` that goes with it, and the `curly braces`, and write the body of the function as the expression whose value is to be returned:
```js
const sum = (x,y) => { return x + y; };

const sum = (x,y) => x + y;
```

If an arrow function has exactly one parameter, parentheses around the parameter can be omitted:
```js
let double = n => n * 2;

const square = x => x * x;

const polynomial = x => x*x + 2*x + 3;
```

Function with no arguments at all must be written with an empty pair of parentheses:
```js
let sayHi = () => alert("Hello");  

const constanFunc = () => 42;

const horn = () => { console.log("Toot"); };
```

#### **Arrow Function with a Block (Multi-line)**

If you need multiple statements in the function body, you must use curly braces `{}` and explicitly include the `return` statement.

```js
const roundTo = (n, step) => {
	let remainder = n % step;
	return n - remainder;
};
```

```js
let sum = (a, b) => {
	let result = a + b;
	return result;
};

alert(sum(1, 2));  
// 3
```

Using ternary to define a appropriate function.
```js
let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

let welcome = (age < 18) ? () => alert('Hello') : () => alert('Greetings');

Welcome();

// 18 is default, 
// if less than 18, hello
// otherwise greetings
```

---

If the body of arrow function is a single return statement but the expression to be returned is an object literal, then you have to put the object literal inside parentheses to avoid syntactic ambiguity between the curly braces of a function body and the curly braces of an object literal:

```js
const f = x => { return { value: x }; };
// Good: f() returns an object

const g = x => ({ value: x });
// Good: g() returns an object

const h = x => { value: x };
// Bad: h() returns nothing

const i = x => { v: x, w: x };
// Bad: Syntax Error
```

### Arrow Function as Arguments

The concise syntax of arrow functions makes them ideal when you need to pass one function to another function, which is a common thing to do with array methods like map(), filter(), and reduce()

```js
// Make a copy of an array with null elements removed.
let filtered = [1,null,2,3].filter(x => x !== null); 
// filtered == [1,2,3]

// Square some numbers:
let squares = [1,2,3,4].map(x => x*x);
// squares == [1,4,9,16]
```

```js
function ask(question, yes, no) {
  if (confirm(question)) yes();
  else no();
}

ask(
  "Do you agree?",
  () => alert("You agreed."),
  () => alert("You canceled the execution.")
);
```

```js
ask(
	"Do you agree?",
	function() { alert("You agreed.");},
	function() { alert("You canceled the execution."); }
);
```



### Arrow Functions and 'this'

Arrow functions behave differently from regular functions when it comes to the `this` keyword. They **do not have their own `this`**. Instead, they inherit `this` from the **lexical scope** (i.e., the surrounding environment in which they are defined in rather than defining their own). 
This is a very important and useful feature of Arrow functions.

```js
let user = {
	firstName: "John",
	sayHi() {
		let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);  
		// `this` refers to the `user` object
		arrow();
	}
};

user.sayHi();  // Output: "John"
```

In this example, the `arrow()` function inherits `this` from the `sayHi()` method, which refers to the `user` object.

### Arrow Functions Cannot Be Used as Constructors

Since arrow functions do not have their own `this`, they **cannot be used as constructors**. You cannot call an arrow function with `new`.

```js
const Person = (name) => {
	this.name = name;
};

let john = new Person("John");  // Error: Person is not a constructor
```

In this example, `Person` is an arrow function, and calling it with `new` will throw an error because arrow functions don't have their own `this`, which is required for object creation via `new`.

#### Arrow Functions in 'forEach' and Similar Methods

Arrow functions are useful in methods like `forEach` because they **preserve the `this` context** from the surrounding code:

```js
let group = {
	title: "Our Group",
	students: ["John", "Pete", "Alice"],
	showList() {
		this.students.forEach(
			student => alert(this.title + ': ' + student)  // `this` refers to `group`
    );
  }
};

group.showList();  // Output: "Our Group: John", "Our Group: Pete", "Our Group: Alice"
```

In this case, the arrow function inside `forEach` inherits `this` from the `showList()` method, which refers to the `group` object.

#### Regular Function in 'forEach'

If we use a regular function inside `forEach`, the value of `this` changes to `undefined` in strict mode, or the global object (`window` in browsers) in non-strict mode:

```js
let group = {
	title: "Our Group",
	students: ["John", "Pete", "Alice"],
	showList() {
		this.students.forEach(function(student) {
			alert(this.title + ': ' + student);  // Error: `this` is undefined or refers to the global object
    });
  }
};

group.showList();  // Error: Cannot read property 'title' of undefined
```
Error because when `forEach` runs function with `this=undefined` by default. This doesn't affect arrow functions because they don't have `this`.

Here, the function passed to `forEach` does not have its own `this` and refers to the global context instead of the `group` object, leading to an error.

- Regular functions create their own `this` context, which means inside the `forEach` method, `this` is no longer the `group` object.
- Arrow functions do not create their own `this`; instead, they **inherit** it from the surrounding scope, making them ideal for cases like the `forEach` method where you want to preserve the context.

### Summary of Arrow Functions

- **Syntax**: Arrow functions use the `=>` syntax, making them more concise than regular function expressions.
- **No `this` binding**: Arrow functions do not have their own `this`. Instead, they inherit it from the surrounding scope, making them useful for methods like `forEach`.
- **Single-expression functions**: If the body is a single expression, the `return` keyword is implicit, and you can omit the curly braces.
- **Cannot be used as constructors**: Arrow functions cannot be invoked with `new` because they do not have their own `this`.
