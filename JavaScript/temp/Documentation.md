## Specification

[The ECMA-262 specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) contains the most in-depth, detailed and formalized information about JavaScript. It defines the language.

A new specification version is released every year. Between these releases, the latest specification draft is at [https://tc39.es/ecma262/](https://tc39.es/ecma262/).

To read about new bleeding-edge features, including those that are “almost standard” (so-called “stage 3”), see proposals at [https://github.com/tc39/proposals](https://github.com/tc39/proposals).

Also, if you’re developing for the browser, then there are other specifications covered in the [second part](https://javascript.info/browser-environment) of the tutorial.

***DOM specification***
Describes the document structure, manipulations, and events, see [https://dom.spec.whatwg.org](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/).

***CSSOM specification***
Describes stylesheets and style rules, manipulations with them, and their binding to documents, see [https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/).

***HTML specification***
Describes the HTML language (e.g. tags) and also the BOM (browser object model) – various browser functions: `setTimeout`, `alert`, `location` and so on, see [https://html.spec.whatwg.org](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/). It takes the DOM specification and extends it with many additional properties and methods.

Additionally, some classes are described separately at [https://spec.whatwg.org/](https://spec.whatwg.org/).

When you’d like to read about a property or a method, the Mozilla manual at [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is also a nice resource, but the corresponding spec may be better: it’s more complex and longer to read, but will make your fundamental knowledge sound and complete.

## Manuals

- **MDN (Mozilla) [JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference) ** is the main manual with examples and other information. It’s great to get in-depth information about individual language functions, methods etc.

Although, it’s often best to use an internet search instead. Just use “MDN [term]” in the query.
#### Compatibility tables
To see their support among browser-based and other engines, see:

- [https://caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) – per-feature tables of support,
- [https://kangax.github.io/compat-table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table) – a table with language features and engines that support those or don’t support.
