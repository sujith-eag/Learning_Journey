When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), in short: “OOP”.

OOP is a big thing, an interesting science of its own. How to choose the right entities? How to organize the interaction between them? That’s architecture, and there are great books on that topic, like 
“Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” by E. Gamma, R. Helm, R. Johnson, J. Vissides or 
“Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications” by G. Booch, and more.
