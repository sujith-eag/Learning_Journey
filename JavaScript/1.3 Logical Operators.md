## Logical Operators 
##### `|| (OR)   && (AND)  ! (NOT)   ?? (Nullish Coalescing)`

Logical operators are used to reason about Boolean.
They can be applied to values of any type, not just Boolean.


### `||  OR`
`||` operator denotes logical `or`. True if any of its arguments is true.

```js
let hour = 9;
let isWeekend = true;

if (hour < 10 || hour > 18 || isWeekend) {
	alert( 'The office is closed.' );
}
```

From left to right for each operand is converted to boolean. If result is true, stops.

A chain of OR || returns the first truthy value or the last one if no truthy value is found.
(returns the first truthy value)
```js
alert( 1 || 0 );    // 1   (1 is truthy)
alert (null || 1);  // 1  (1 is truthy)
alert (null || 0 || 1);  // 1
alert ( undefined || null || 0);  // 0

alert( first || last || Nickname || "Anonymous");   // anonymus, if all fail
```


***Short-circuit evaluation*** means, when first truthy value is reached, it is returned immediately without going for other arguments. Used to execute the command only if the left is false/falsey. 
```js
true || alert("not printed");   // alert not run
false || alert("printed");     // alert is run
```




### `&& AND`

`&&` represent logical `and`.   True only if both values are true

```js
if (hour == 12 && minute == 30) {
	alert ( "The time is 12:30");
}

if (1 && 0) {
	alert( "wont work as one of it is falsey");
}
```

#### `&&` finds the first falsy value
```js
result = value1 && value2 && value3;

alert ( 1 && 0);  // 0
alert (1 && 5);  // 5

alert ( null && 5); // null
alert ( 0 && "whatever");  // 0

alert ( 1 && 2 && null && 3);  // null
alert ( 1 && 2 && 3);   // 3
```
From left to right, converting each operand to Boolean, if the result is false, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
If all are truthy, then the last one is returned.

Precedence of AND is higher than OR (And gets executed first)
```js
a && b || c && d 
// both are equal
(a && b) || (c && d)

alert( null || 2 && 3 || 4);
// 2 && 3 returns 3,   null || 3 || 4  so returns 3
```



### `! NOT`

`!` is sign for `not` which flips the value given to it
```js
result = !value;
alert (!true);  // false
alert (!0); // true

// to check that the age is not between 14 and 90 inclusively
if ( !(age >= 14 && age <= 90));
if ( age < 14 || age > 90);
```

The precedence of NOT is higher than all logical operators so gets executed first.

```js
if (-1 || 0) alert ('first');
if (-1 && 0) alert ('second'):
if (null || -1 && 1) alert ('third');

// first and third will become true and execute
// -1 is truthy
```

```js
if ( (iceCreamVanOutside || houseStatus === "on fire")) {
	console.log("you should leave the house quickly");
} else {
	console.log("you should just stay in then")
}


if ( !(iceCreamVanOutside || houseStatus === "on fire")) {
	console.log("you should just stay in then");
} else {
	console.log("you should leave the house quickly")
}
```

***Password Verification***
```js
let userName = prompt ("Who's there?", '');

if (userName === "Admin") {

	let pass = prompt ('Password?', '');

	if (pass === 'TheMaster') {
		alert ("Welcome!");
		}
	else if (pass === '' || pass === null) {
		alert ( 'Canceled');
		}
	else {
		alert ( 'Wrong password');
		}
}
else if (userName === '' || userName === null) {
	alert ( 'Cancelled')
}
else {
	alert ( "I don't know you");
}
```

### Ternary Operator / Conditional Operator  `C ? ifT : ifF` 

Is a bit of syntax that tests a condition  and returns one value/expression if it is `true`, and another if it is `false`.   Can be used in place of if else block in short code.
```js
	condition ? run this code : run this code instead
console.log(true ? 1 : 2);    //1
console.log(false ? 1 : 2);    //2

const greeting = isBirthday ? "Happy birthday" : "Good morning";


let result = condition ? value1 : value2;

select.value === "black" 
	? update ("black", "white")  : update ("white", "black");


let age = prompt("age?", 18);

let message = (age < 3) ? "Hi, baby" :
	(age < 18) ? "hello" :
		(age < 100) ? "Greetings" :
			"what an unusual age" ;

alert (message);
```
The operator uses the value/expression to the left of `?`  to decide which one of the two values to pick.
`a ? b : c`  will be `b` when `a` is true,   `c` if `a` is false.

## Short Circuiting of logical operators

`&&  ??  ||`  also handle values of different types in a peculiar way.
They convert the value on the left side to Boolean type in order to decide what to do.
they might return either the original left-hand value or the right-hand value.

______

`||` operator will return the left value when that value can be converted to true otherwise returns what on the right side.
(0, Nan and " " count as false  while others are true)
```js
console.log (null || "user");   // user
console.log("Agnes" || "user"); //  Agnes
```

we can use this as a way to fall back on a default value.
If there is a value that might be empty, you can put `||` after it with a replacement value.
If initial value is false/empty, the replacement will be passed.

____

`??` is similar to `||` but it returns the value on the right only if the value on the left is `null` or `undefined`     not when it is some other value that can be converted to false like 0 or ""
So this is more preferable than `||` as it is more predictable.
```js
console.log(0 || 100);   // 100
console.log(0 ?? 100);    // 0
console.log(null ?? 100); // 100
```
____

`&&` operator works in the opposite way to `?? and ||`

If value on its left converts to false, it returns that value only.
if its true then returns the value on the right.

___

The part of their right is evaluated only when it is necessary that is
when `true || x`   and  `false && x`
x will never be evaluated, it is ignored, this is called ***Short-circuit evaluation***

The conditional operator works in similar way, of the second and third values, only the one that is selected is evaluated
```js
console.log(true ? 1 : 2);   // 1
console.log(false ? 1 : 2);   // 2
```
