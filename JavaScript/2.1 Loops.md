# Looping through a collection

###  `for...of` loop
A basic tool to loop through a collection like an array.
```js
const cats = ["Lepord", "jaguar", "Tiger"];

for (const cat of cats) {
	console.log(cat);
}
```

### `map()`
Map is used to do something to each item in a collection and create a new collection containing the changed items:
```js
function toUpper(string) {
	return string.toUpperCase();
}

const cats = ["Lepord", "jaguar", "Tiger", "Lion"];

const upperCats = cats.map(toUpper);

console.log(upperCats);    // all will be in full capital
```
Here the `cats` are passed to `map`. The `map()` calls the function each time for each item in the array and passing in that item. Then adds the return item to the new array.

### `filter()`
is used to test each item in the collection, and create a new collection containing only the items that matched the condition.
The passed function to `filter` returns a boolean. If true it is added, if false, then not.
```js
function lCat(cat) {
	return cat.startsWith("L")
}

const cats = ["Lepord", "jaguar", "Tiger", "Lion"];

const newList = cats.filter(lCat);
console.log(newList);  // [Lepord, Lion]
```

# Standard Loop

# `for` loop

When there is no collection of items to loop through, for loop can be used.
```js
for ( initializer; condition; final-expression; ) {
	// code to run
}

for (let number = 0; number <= 12; number = number +2) {
	console.log(number);
}
// 0, 2 ... 10
```

Initializer / counter variable
	The first part initializes the loop, usually by defining a binding set to a number. which will be incremented to count the number of times loop has run. 

Condition
	The second part is expression/condition that checks if loop must continue or stop. Generally containing expression with comparison operator to check if the required condition has been met.

Final-expression
	This is always run every time a loop is completed full iteration to update the state of loop. Usually serves to increment or decrement the counter variable to bring it closer to a point where the condition is not true.

The curly braces`{}` that contains the code will be run for each iteration.

```js
let result = 1;

for (let counter = 0; counter < 10; counter = counter + 1) {
	result = result * 2;
}
console.log(result);

// 1024


function calculate() {
	for ( let i = 1; i<10; i++) {
		const newResult = '${i} x ${i} = ${i*i}';
		}
}
```


```js
for (const cat of cats) {
	console.log(cat);
}

for (i = 0; i < cats.length; i++) {
	console.log( cats[i] );
}


// to get 'and' before the last cats name.
const cats = ["Lepord", "jaguar", "Tiger", "Lion"];
let myFavouriteCats = "My cats are called ";

for (let i = 0; i < cats.length; i++) {
	if (i === cats.length -1) {
		myFavouriteCats += 'and ${cats[i]}.';
		}
	else {
		myFavouriteCats += '${cats[i]}, ';
		}
}
console.log( myFavouriteCats);
// My cats are called Lepord, jaguar, Tiger, and Lion.
```

***Updating Bindings Succinctly***
```js
counter = counter + 1;    counter += 1;    counter ++;

counter -= 1;   counter --;

result *= 2;
```

# `while` and `do...while` loops

## `while`

Similar to `for` loop, the same three parts exist in same order but spread out from keyword.
```js
initializer / counter variable
while (condition) {
	// code to run

	final-expression
}
```

```js
let number = 0;

while (number <= 12) {
	console.log(number);
	number = number + 2;
}

// 0  2 ... 10
```

```js
let result = 1;
let counter = 0;

while (counter < 10) {
	result = 2 * result;
	counter = counter + 1;
}
console.log(result);

// 1024  (finding 2 to the power of 10)
```

## `do...while`

a `do` loop always executes its body at least once, and it starts testing whether it should stop only after that first execution. as the code comes before the condition.
```js
initializer / counter variable
do {
	// code to run
	final-expression
	} 
while (condition)
```

```js
let yourName;

do {
	yourName = prompt("who are you?");
	} while (!yourName);
console.log("Hello" + yourName);
```

This program will force you to enter a name unless it is not an empty string " ".
Applying `!` operator converts a value to Boolean type and all strings except " " convert to true.


***Indenting Code***
is optional in `js`,  the computer will accept the code without them and can even be written in a single line. The indentation makes the code more readable to humans.

```js
if (true != false) {
	console.log("That makes sense.");
	if (1 < 2) {
		console.log("No surprise there.);
		}
}
```

## Breaking out of a loop

### `break`
The `break` statement has the effect of immediately jumping out of the enclosing loop.

Finding a number that is greater than or equal to 20 and divisible by 7
```js
for (let current = 20; current = current + 1) {
	if (current % 7 == 0) {
	console.log(current);
	break;
	}
}
// 21
```

### `continue`
`continue` influences the the progress of a loop. 
when `continue` is enclosed in a loop body, control jumps stops executing the code in the loop, jumps out of the body and continues with the next iteration of the loop.
```js
for (let i = 0; i<10; i++) {
	if (i%2 == 0) continue;
	alert(i);  //  1, 3, 5, 7, 9
}
```


### Labels for `break/continue`

To break out of multiple loops at once.
A label is an identifier with a colon before a loop;
```js
labelName: for (...){
	...
	}

labelName:
for (...){
	...
	}
```

The `break labelName` breaks out of the named loop.
```js
outer:
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
	for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
		let input = prompt ('Value at coords ( ${i},${j})' , '' );
	// if an empty string or cancelled, then break out of both loops
	if (!input) break outer;
		}
}
alert ('Done!');
```
