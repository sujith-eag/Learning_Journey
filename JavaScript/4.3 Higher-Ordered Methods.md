## Rest Parameters

To accept any number of arguments given.
`Math.max` computes the maximum of all the arguments it is given.

To write such a function, put three dots before the function's last parameter
```js
function max(...numbers) {
	let result = -Infinity;
	for (let number of numbers) {
		if (number > result) result = number;
		}
	return result;
}

console.log(max(4, 1, 9, -2));    // 9

let numbers = [5, 1, 7];
console.log(max(...numbers));    // 7

console.log(max(9, ...numbers, 2));
```
`rest parameter` is bound to an array containing all further arguments.

Similar three dot notation is used to call a function with an array of arguments;

Square bracket array notation similarly allows triple-dot operator to spread another array into a new array.
This works even in curly brace objects to add all property from another object.
If a property is added multiple times, the last value to be added wins.

```js
let words = ["never", "fully"];
console.log(["will", ...words, "understand"]);
// ["will", "never", "fully", "understand"]

let coordinates = {x:10, y:0};
console.log({...coordinates, y:5, z:1})
// {x:10, y:5, z:1}
```



### Filtering Arrays (A standard Array function)
Filtering out an array that doesn't pass a test. This is a pure function, not altering the given array. Similar to `forEach`, `filter` is a standard array function, No need to write code like below.
```js
function filte(array, test) {
	let passed = [];
	for (let element of array) {
		if (test(element)) {
			passed.push(element);
			}
		}
		return passed;
} 
console.log( filter(SCRIPTS, script => script.living));
// [{name: "Adlam", ...}, ...]
```

```js
console.log( SCRIPTS.filter(s => s.direction == "ttb"));
// [{name: "Mongolian",...},...]
```


## Transforming with Map

The `map` method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from returned values. The new array will have been mapped to a new form by the function.
```js
function map(array, transform) {
	let mapped = [];
	for (let element of array) {
		mapped.push(transform(element));
	}
	return mapped;
}
```


## Summarizing with Reduce

It builds a value by repeatedly taking a single element from the array and combining it with the current value.
