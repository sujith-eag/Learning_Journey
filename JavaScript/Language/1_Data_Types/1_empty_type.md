### Empty values

`null` is used to assign an `empty`, `nothing` or `value unkown` value to a variable.

`undefined` means `value is not assigned` 
It as a default initial value when variable is declared but value is not assigned.
Many operations yield `undefined` when they have to yield some value if the operation don't produce a meaningful value. 


`null`  and  `undefined`  are used to denote the absence of meaningful value / value unknown.
These two are values but they do not carry no information. Both are mostly interchangeable.
