A function that is a property of an object is called its method.
Methods allow objects to “act” like `object.doSomething()`.

```js
let user = {
	name: "John"
};
user.sayHi = function() {
	alert("Hello");
};

user.sayHi();  // Hello
```
now we have method `sayHi` of object `user`.
We can also pre-declare a function and then add to the object.
```js
function sayHi() {alert("Hello"); }

user.sayHi = sayHi;
user.sayHi();  // Hello
```

#### Method Shorthand
We can omit the `function` and just write `sayHi()`
```js
user = {
	sayHi() {
		alert( "Hello" )
		};
}

// instead of 
user = {
	sayHi: function() {
		alert("Hello");
		};
};
```

# `this` in methods

It is common that an ***object method*** needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job.
To access the object, a method can use `this` keyword.

The `this` keyword typically refers to the current object the code is being executed in. 

```js
let user = {
	name: "John";

	sayHi() {
		alert( this.name );
		}
};

user.sayHi(); // John
```
During execution, the value of `this` will be `user`.


#### `this` is not bound
`this` can be used in any function, even if its not a method of an object.
The value is evaluated at run time depending on context.
In JavaScript `this` is “free”, its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, but rather on what object is “before the dot”.


The object can be accessed normally without using `this`,  `user.name` but by using `this`, it allows for same method definition to be used in multiple objects. 
```js
introduceSeelf() {
console.log( `Hi I'm ${this.name[0]}.`)
}
```
It will be essential while using constructors to create more than one object from a single object.
```js
const person1 = {
  name: "Chris",
  introduceSelf() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
  },
};

const person2 = {
  name: "Deepthi",
  introduceSelf() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
  },
};
```

### A calculator
- `read()` prompts for two values and saves them as object properties with names `a` and `b` respectively.
- `sum()` returns the sum of saved values.
- `mul()` multiplies saved values and returns the result.
```js
let calculator = {
	read() {
		this.a = +prompt('give a ?', 0);
		this.b = +prompt('give b ?', 0);
		},
	sum() {
		return this.a + this.b;
		},
	multipy() {
		return this.a * this.b;
		}
};

calculator.read();  // calling for input
alert( claculator.sum() );
alert( calcularor.multiply() );
```


### Chaining

Several calls can be chained together
```js
let ladder = {
	step: 0,

	up() {
		this.step++;
		},
	down() {
		this.step--;
		},
	showStep() {
		alert( this.step);
		}
};
```
```js
ladder.up();
ladder.down();

// the calls can be chained together
ladder.up().up().down().showStep().down();
```
