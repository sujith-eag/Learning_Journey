The regular `{...}` syntax allows us to create one object. 

Using ***constructor functions*** and the `"new"` operator, many similar objects, like multiple users or menu items can be made.

## Constructor function

Constructor functions technically are regular functions. There are two conventions though:
1. They are named with capital letter first.
2. They should be executed only with `"new"` operator.

```js
function User(name) {
	this.name = name;
	this.isAdmin = false;
}  // constructor function

let person = new User("Jack")  // constructor

alert(person.name);  // Jack
alert(person.isAdmin); // false
```
Any function except arrow function can be used as a constructor. The first capital letter is to make it clear that this function has to be run with `new`.


constructor function is like Defining the "shape" of an object — the set of methods and the properties it can have — and then create as many objects as we like, just updating the values for the properties that are different.

The first version of this is just a function:
```js
// takes a parameter name
function createPerson(name) {
	const obj = {};    // create object
	
	obj.name = name;    // add name property
	
	obj.introduceSelf = function () { // add a method
	    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
	  };
	return obj;
}
```
With different names passed, this is a common way to create new objects. but the `introduceSelf()` method will be same for all objects.
```js
const frank = createPerson("Frank");

frank.introduceSelf();  // Hi I'm Frank.
```

It is better to use a constructor.
A constructor is just a function called using `new` keyword.
When a constructor is called, it will:
- create a new object
- bind `this` to the new object, so you can refer to `this` in your constructor code
- run the code in the constructor
- return the new object.

Constructors, by convention, start with a capital letter and are named for the type of object they create. 
```js
// making a constructor
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.introduceSelf = function () {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
  };
}

// Old method 
function createPerson(name) {
  const obj = {};
  obj.name = name;
  obj.introduceSelf = function () {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
  };
  return obj;
}
```

To call `Person()` as a constructor, `new` is used
```js
const frankie = new Person("Frankie");
frankie.introduceSelf();   // "Hi! I'm Frankie."
```



The read function cannot be made as `this.read() {}` doesn't work
```js
function Accumilator(startingValue) {
	this.value = startingValue;
	
	this.read = function() {
		this.value += +prompt ('How much to add?', 0);
		};
}

let accumulator = new Accumulator(1);
accumulator.read();
alert( accumulator.value);
```


# Objects are everywhere

```js
myString.split(",");
```
Every time a string is created, that string is automatically created as an instance of `string` object and there fore has all string methods and properties available to it.
