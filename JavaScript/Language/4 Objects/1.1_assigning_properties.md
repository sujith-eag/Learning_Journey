## Setting object members

The values of objects can be set by declaring the members using any notation and using assignment operator.
This creates new property on the object or replaces the old properties value.
```js
person.age = 45;
person["name"]["last"] = "Cratch";
```
New members can also be created 
```js
person["eyes"] = "hazel";
person.farewell = function () {
	  console.log("Bye everybody!");
	};
```

Bracket notation is useful that it can be used to set the members name and also the members value dynamically.
(user gives member name and value)
```js
const dataName = nameInput.value;
const dataValue = nameValue.value;

person[dataName] = dataValue;

const dataName = "height";
const dataValue = "1.70m";

person [dataName] = dataValue;
```
This way of adding a property to an object is not possible with dot notation. As it only accepts a literal number name, not a variable value pointing to a name.

___

```js
let day1 = {
	squirel: false,
	events: ["work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running"]
};
```
Reading a property that doesn't exist gives `undefined`
```js
console.log(day1.squirrel);  // false
console.log(day1.wolf);  // undefined

day1.wolf = false;
console.log(day1.wolf);  // false

delete day1.squirrel;
console.log(day1.squirrel);  // undefined
```
`delete` is an unary operator that removes the named property from an object.


## Computed properties
We can use square brackets in an object literal, when creating an object. That's called computed properties.
```js
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple"); // second part is default
let bag = {
	[fruit]: 5,
};
alert( bag.apple );  // 5

// [fruit] menas property name is taken from fruit.
// so bag will have  { apple: 5}
```
That works the same as
```js
let fruit = prompt("What fruit to buy?", "apple");
let bag = {};

bag[fruit] = 5; // take property name from fruit variable
```
more complex expressions inside the bracket
```js
let fruit = "apple";
let bag = {
	[fruit + 'Computers' ]; 5   // bag.appleComputers = 5
};
```

#### Mutability

The object values can be modified. Properties can be changed causing a single object value to have different content at different times.
> Strings, Numbers, and Boolean's are immutable, cannot be changed in place
```js
let object1 = {value: 10};
object1.value = 15;
```
