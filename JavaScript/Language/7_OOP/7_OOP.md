When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), in short: “OOP”.

Object Oriented programming, a set of techniques that use objects as the central principle of program organization.
The main idea is to use `types` of objects as the unit of program organisation.
Setting up the program as a strictly separated object types provides a way to think about its structure and thus to enforce some kind of discipline, preventing everything from becoming entangled.

## Abstract Data Type

abstract data type or object class is a subprogram that may contain arbitrarily complex code, but exposes a limited set of methods and properties that people who are working with it are supposed to use. (mixer with its knobs)

This allows large programs to be built up out of a number of appliance types, limiting the degree to which these different parts are interacting.
If a problem is found in one such object class, it can often be repaired or even completely rewritten, without impacting the rest of the program.

Objects can be even used in different programs, avoiding recreating it.

## Methods

In `js` methods are nothing more than properties that hold function values.
A method needs to to something with the object it was called on.

`this`
