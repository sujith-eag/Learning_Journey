### 3. Arrow Functions

Third notation for function which uses `=>` arrow instead of the `function` keyword.
```js
let func = (arg1, arg2,..,argN) => expression;
```
This creates a `func` that accepts arguments `arg1..` then evaluates the `expression` on the right side.
```
function func (arg1,...) {
	return expression;
	}

let func = function(arg1, arg2, ..,argN) {
	return expression;
	};
```

The arrow comes after the list of parameters and followed by the function body.
> This input (parameters)  produces this result (the body)
```js
let sum = (a, b) => a + b;

let double = n => n*2;

const square = (x) => {return x * x;};

const square = x => x * x;

let sayHi = () => alert("Hello");
```
When there is only one parameter, `()` can be omitted.
If body is single expression, rather than a block in braces, that expression will be returned from the function even without `return` statement.

```js
let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

let welcome = (age < 18) ? () => alert('Hello') : () => alert('Greetings');

Welcome();

// 18 is default, 
// if less than 18, hello
// otherwise greetings
```

***Multiline arrow functions***
If there are multi line expressions, `{}` curly brace is used for the expression block and a `return` statement has to be given when `{}` is used.
```js
const roundTo = (n, step) => {
	let remainder = n % step;
	return n - remainder;
	};

let sum = (a, b) => {
	let result = a + b;
	return result;
	};
alert( sum(1,2));   // 3
```


When `=>` arrow function doesn't have any parameters, its parameter list is just an empty set of parentheses. `()`,  they must be present
```js
const horn = () => {
	console.log("Toot");
};
```

```js

function ask (question, yes, no) {
	if( confirm(question)) yes();
	else no();
}

ask(
	"Do you agree?",
	function() { alert("You agreed.");},
	function() { alert("You canceled the execution."); }
);

// rewriting with arrow function
ask(
	"Do you agree?",
	() => alert("You agreed."),
	() => alert("You cancelled the execution.")
);
```

### Arrow function have no `this`.

Arrow functions are special: they don’t have their “own” `this`. If we reference `this` from such a function, it’s taken from the outer “normal” function.

```js
let user = {
	firstName = "John",
	sayHi() {
		let arrow = ()=> alert(this.firstName);
		arrow();
		}
};

user.sayHi();  // John
```
Here `arrow()` uses `this` from the outer `user.sayHi()` method


```js
let group = {
	title: "Our Group",
	students: ["John", "Pete", "Alice"],

	showList() {
		this.students.forEach(
			student => alert(this.title + ': ' + student)
		);
		}
};

group.showList();  // Our Group: John ...
```
here in `forEach` the arrow function is used so `this.title` is same as outer method `group.title`


```js
	// same but not using arrow function
	...
	showList() {
		this.students.forEach( function (student) {
			alert(this.title + ': ' + student);
		});
		}
// error: cannot read property 'title' of undefined
```
Error because when `forEach` runs function with `this=undefined` by default. This doesn't affect arrow functions because they don't have `this`.

This is a special feature of arrow functions, it’s useful when we actually do not want to have a separate `this`, but rather to take it from the outer context.

Since it doesn't have `this`, arrow functions cannot be used as constructors as they can't be called with `new`.
