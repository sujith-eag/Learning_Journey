## Short Circuiting of logical operators

`&&  ??  ||`  also handle values of different types in a peculiar way.
They convert the value on the left side to Boolean type in order to decide what to do.
they might return either the original left-hand value or the right-hand value.

______

`||` operator will return the left value when that value can be converted to true otherwise returns what on the right side.
(0, Nan and " " count as false  while others are true)
```js
console.log (null || "user");   // user
console.log("Agnes" || "user"); //  Agnes
```

we can use this as a way to fall back on a default value.
If there is a value that might be empty, you can put `||` after it with a replacement value.
If initial value is false/empty, the replacement will be passed.

____

`&&` operator works in the opposite way to `?? and ||`

If value on its left converts to false, it returns that value only.
if its true then returns the value on the right.

___

The part of their right is evaluated only when it is necessary that is
when `true || x`   and  `false && x`
x will never be evaluated, it is ignored, this is called ***Short-circuit evaluation***

The conditional operator works in similar way, of the second and third values, only the one that is selected is evaluated
```js
console.log(true ? 1 : 2);   // 1
console.log(false ? 1 : 2);   // 2
```
