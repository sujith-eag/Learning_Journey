### Ternary Operator / Conditional Operator  

`?` is called a "ternary" because the operator has three operands.
Which is the only operator in `js` that has that many.

"conditional" or "question mark" operator lets us do what can be done with `if else` in simpler way.
Is a bit of syntax that tests a condition and returns one value / expression if it is `true`, and another if it is `false`. 
```js
let result = condition ? value1 : value2;

boolean ? runIfTrue : runIfFalse
```

```js
if (age > 18) {
	accessAllowed = true;
} else {
	accessAllowed = false;
}

let accessAllowed = (age > 18) ? true : false;
```
The `?` operator has low precedence so runs after `>`
 
```js
console.log(true ? 1 : 2);    //1
console.log(false ? 1 : 2);    //2

const greeting = isBirthday ? "Happy birthday" : "Good morning";
```

```js
// switching b/w black and white theme
select.value === "black" ? update("black", "white") : update ("white", "black");
// make black to white,  or  white to black
```


### Multiple `?`

```js
let age = prompt("age?", 18);

let message = (age < 3) ? "Hi, baby" : // if true run
	(age < 18) ? "hello" :  // check, if true hello
		(age < 100) ? "Greetings" : // check, if true greeting
			"what an unusual age" ; // nothing was true

alert (message);
```
The operator uses the value/expression to the left of `?`  to decide which one of the two values to pick.
`a ? b : c`  will be `b` when `a` is true,   `c` if `a` is false.

Same using the `if..else`
```js
if (age < 3) {
	message = 'Hi baby';
} else if (age < 18) {
	message = 'Hello';
} else if (age < 100) {
	messsage = 'Greetings';
} else {
	message = 'What an unusual age';
}
```

### Non-traditional use of `?`

```js
let company = prompt('which company?', '');

(company == 'Netscape') ? alert('Right!') : alert('Wrong.');
```
We don’t assign a result to a variable here. Instead, we execute different code depending on the condition.
**It’s not recommended to use the question mark operator in this way.**
It is not recommended to use `?` in this way as it is less readable.

Our eyes scan the code vertically. Code blocks which span several lines are easier to understand than a long, horizontal instruction set.

The purpose of the question mark operator `?` is to return one value or another depending on its condition. Please use it for exactly that. Use `if` when you need to execute different branches of code.

#### No `break/continue` to the right side of ‘?’

Please note that syntax constructs that are not expressions cannot be used with the ternary operator `?`. 
In particular, directives such as `break/continue` aren’t allowed there.

For example, if we take this code:
```js
if (i>5) {
	alert(i);
} else {
continue;
}

(i>5) ? alert(i) : continue;
// continue is not allowed here
```
