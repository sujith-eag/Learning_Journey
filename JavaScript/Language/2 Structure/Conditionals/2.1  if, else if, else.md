## Conditional execution / branching

### `if()`

When we want some code to run if and only if some condition holds using Boolean expression.
```js
if (hour < 18) {
	greeting = "Good Day";
}

// to show the square input only if the input is actually a number.

let theNumber = Number(prompt("pick a number"));

if (!Number.isNaN(theNumber)) {
	console.log("Your number is square root of " + theNumber*theNumber);
}
```

The `Number` function returns `Nan` if its a string that does not represent a number.
`Number.isNaN` is a standard function that returns true only if the argument is `NaN`.
so  'unless `theNumber` is not-a-number, do this'

The statement after the `if` wrapped in `{}` is used to group any number of statements into a single statement called block.
They can be avoided for just one statement
` if (1+1 == 2) console.log("It's true");`

### `else` 

`else` clause is used to create an alternate path when the `if` condition is `false`.
```js
let theNumber = Number(prompt("Pick a number"));

if (!Number.isNaN(theNumber)) {
	console.log("Your number is the square of " + theNumber*theNumber);
} else {
	console.log("why didn't you give me a number?");
}
```

### `else if`

When there are more than two paths / conditions, `else if`
```js
let num = Number(prompt("Pick a number"));

if (num < 10) {
	console.log("Small");
} else if (num < 100) {
	console.log("Medium");
} else {
	console.log("Large");
}
```

`if` number is less than 10, prints small and is done. 
if it isn't, then takes `else` branch which contains a second `if`,
if that isn't, moves to next `else` block.
