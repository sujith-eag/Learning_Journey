## `switch` statements   

The switch statement can replace multiple `if` checks.
It gives a more descriptive way to compare a value with multiple variants.

The `switch` has one or more `case` blocks and an optional default.

`switch()  case x:  default:`
```js
switch (x) {
	case value1:  // if (x === value1) 
		//run this code
		[break];
		
	case value2:  // if (x === value2) 
		// run this code
		[break];
		
	default:
		// if none matched, just run this code
		[break];
}
```
`[break]` is in brackets to represent it is optional.
```js
if (x == "value1") action1();
else if (x == "value2") action2();
else if (x == "vlaue3") action();
else defaultAction();
```

* Switch takes single expression or value as an input, and then look through several choices until they find one that matches that value.
* When the equality is found `switch` starts executing the starting from the corresponding`case`.
* Execution continues till the nearest `break`, or end of `switch`.
* As many number of `case` can be put inside the block opened by `switch`
* if no case is matched, then `default` code is executed if exists.
* If there is no `break` ***then the execution continues with the next `case` without any checks***

```js
let a = 2 + 2;

switch (a) {
	case 3:
		alert( 'Too small'); 
		break;
	case 4:
		alert( "Exactly" );
		break;
	default:
		alert( "I dont know such values" );
}
```

```js
switch (prompt("What is the weather like?")) {
	case "rainy":
		console.log("Remember to bring an umbrella.");
		break;
	case "sunny":
		console.log("Dress lightly.");
		break;
	case "cloudy":
		console.log("Go, outside.");
		break;
	default:
		console.log("Unkown weather type!");
		break;
}
```

### Grouping of `case`
Several variants of `case` which share the same code can be grouped.
Same code is run for case 3 and case 5.
```js
let a = 3;

switch(a) {
	case 4:
		alert('Right!');
		break;

	case 3:
	case 5:
		alert('Wrong');
		alert("Why don't you take a math class?");
		break;

	default:
		alert('The result is strange.');
}
```
This is just a side effect of `switch` running as there is no break between two switches so both run.


`switch` uses strict comparison, `'3' != 3`
