##### What are DOC strings? Illustrate with an example.

* Discuss the importance of using docstrings in Python functions. Explain how docstrings enhance code readability and maintainability. Provide an example demonstrating the use of docstrings in a Python function.
* What are DOC strings?

**Answer :**

**DOC Strings**: Documentation strings (or docstrings) are used to document Python code. They are placed at the beginning of modules, functions, classes, or methods to describe their purpose. Docstrings are accessible via the `help()` function.
```python
def my_function():
   """This function does nothing."""
   pass
```

* Illustrate the following with example: i) DOC strings ii) local and global variables iii) pass by reference and pass by value in python
* What is the significance of :  i) Local and global variables    ii) DOC Strings
* Explain the scope of global and local variables.
* Explain the scope of local and global variables.
* Write a Python program that defines both local and global variables and demonstrates their scope and usage. Explain briefly the difference between local and global variables in your program.

**Answer :**

**Local and Global Variables**: Local variables are used within a function or block, whereas global variables are accessible across the entire program. Local variables have function-specific scope, while global variables are accessible throughout the program.

**Local Variable**: A variable defined inside a function or block, accessible only within that function.
```python
def my_function():
   x = 10  # Local variable
   print(x)  # Can access x here

my_function()
# print(x)  # This would raise an error as x is local to my_function
```

**Global Variable**: A variable defined outside any function, accessible throughout the program.
```python
x = 20  # Global variable

def my_function():
   print(x)  # Can access global variable x

my_function()  # Output: 20
print(x)  # Output: 20
```
