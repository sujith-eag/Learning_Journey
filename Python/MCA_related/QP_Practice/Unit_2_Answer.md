## String

##### What is a string? Discuss the different ways of representing a string in Python.

A **string** is a sequence of characters, enclosed in either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`), or triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) for multi-line strings.

- **Single quotes**: 
```python
# single quotes
s1 = 'Hello'

# Double quotes
s2 = "World"

#Triple quotes (for multi-line strings): 
s3 = '''Hello
World
with three lines'''


# String concatenation
full_string = "Hello" + " " + "World"  
# Hello World
```


##### What do you mean by mutable and immutable data structures? Explain with examples.

**Mutable Data Structures:** can be modified or changed after creation. In Python, lists, dictionaries, and sets are mutable. This means we can change, add, or remove elements from these data structures without creating a new object.

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3]
lst[0] = 4  # Modify an element
lst.append(5)  # Add an element
print(lst)  # Output: [4, 2, 3, 5]
```

**Immutable Data Structures:** cannot be changed after they are created. In Python, tuples and strings are immutable. Once created, they cannot be modified or changed. Changes will create a new object.

```python
tup = (1, 2, 3)
tup[0] = 4  
# TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment


str1 = "hello"
str1[0] = "H"  
# TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

##### Demonstrate slicing on strings. Also explain the use of join() and split() string methods with examples.

* Explain the use of join() and split() string methods with examples. What does it mean strings are immutable? Explain with an example.

**Answer :**

**Slicing** allows us to extract a portion of a string.
```python
s = "Hello, World!"
print(s[0:5])  # Output: Hello
print(s[7:])   # Output: World!
print(s[:5])   # Output: Hello
print(s[-1])   # Output: !
```

**`join()`**: Combines elements of an iterable (list, tuple) into a single string, using the string as a separator.
```python
words = ["Python", "is", "fun"]
result = " ".join(words)

print(result)  
# Output: Python is fun
```

**`split()`**: Divides a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.
```python
sentence = "Python is fun"
words = sentence.split()  
# Splits by spaces by default
print(words)  
# Output: ['Python', 'is', 'fun']


sentence = "apple,orange,banana"
fruits = sentence.split(",")  
# Splits by comma
print(fruits)  
# Output: ['apple', 'orange', 'banana']
  ```






##### Develop a python program to find whether the given string is palindrome or not.

```python
if s == s[::-1]:
    print("Palindrome")
else:
    print("Not palindrome")
```


Assume that the name t is assigned a value ‘Programming with Python’ what will be the output when we execute the following commands and explain.
```
t[13:], t[:9], t[:], t[7:16], t[5:-10], t[6:-6:], t[-2::-1], t[::-2],
t[-2:1:-2], t[:-8]
```

Assume that the name a is assigned a value `‘mca@rit’` what will be the output when we execute the following commands and explain.
```
a[5:], t[:4], t[2:-2:2], t[3:4], t[2:-2], t[1:-2:], t[-3::-2], t[::-4],
t[-4:1:-4], t[:-3]
```


Write a python program to count number of vowels and consonants, identify numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters and special characters in a given string.


##### Program to write third person singular form verb

The third person singular verb form in English is distinguished by the suffix -s, which is added to the stem of the infinitive form: run -> runs. A simple set of rules can be given as follows:
* If the verb ends in y, remove it and add ies
* If the verb ends in o, ch, s, sh, x or z, add es
* By default just add s
Develop a Python Script for the rules above

**Answer :**

Logic is to check the last letters using `endswith()` method and since string is immutable, the value is changed by taking slice to remove last letter and concatenating with the plural letters.

```python
def third_person_singular(verb):
    if verb.endswith('y'):
        return verb[:-1] + 'ies'
    elif verb.endswith(('o', 'ch', 's', 'sh', 'x', 'z')):
        return verb + 'es'
    else:
        return verb + 's'

print(third_person_singular("play"))   # Output: plays
print(third_person_singular("go"))     # Output: goes
print(third_person_singular("brush"))  # Output: brushes
print(third_person_singular("fly"))    # Output: flies
```


___
##### Predict the output of the following and justify your answer:
```
i)
S="Vishweswaraiah"
print(s[4:])
print(s[:5])

weswaraiah  
# from index 4 to end

Vishw   
# from beginning, to 4th, excluding 5th
```

```
ii)
str1 = "Bangalore"
str1[1] = "e"
str1[6] = str1[8] = "u"
print(str1)

# TypeError: 'str' does not support assignment
```


```
iii)
a = -45
print(--a)

# -45
# Double negation gets same value
```

```
iv) a, b, c = True, False, False
if a or b and c:
	print "MSRIT"
else:
	print "RNSIT"

# MSRIT
```
The condition `a or b and c` is evaluated as `True or (False and False)`, which is `True`. Hence, the `if` condition is `True`.

## Tuples


##### List and describe any five methods on tuples.

List and describe any five functions to operate Tuples.

**Answer :**

Although tuples are immutable and cannot be modified, there are few methods that can be useful:

`len()` :  Returns the number of elements in the tuple.

count(x)  : Returns the number of occurrences of the element `x` in the tuple.

index(x)  : Returns the index of the first occurrence of element `x` in the tuple. Raises a `ValueError` if `x` is not found.

`max()` and  `min()` : Returns the largest and smallest element in the tuple. The elements must be comparable.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2)

print(len(my_tuple))  # Output: 6

print(my_tuple.count(2)) # Output: 3

print(my_tuple.index(3)) # Output: 2

print(max(my_tuple))  # Output: 3

print(min(my_tuple))  # Output: 1
```




Develop Python script that takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest one using tuples.

UK    41
Japan 9
```

```python
# List of tuples
data_list = [("India", 91), ("USA", 1), ("UK", 41), ("Japan", 9)]
```

```python
# Tuple of tuples
data_tuple = (("India", 91), ("USA", 1), ("UK", 41), ("Japan", 9))
```

```python
# Dictionary
data_dict = {"India": 91, "USA": 1, "UK": 41, "Japan": 9}
```


___

## Lists

How do you demonstrate that lists are equal and identical?

##### When you use the + operator to concatenate two lists, does it make a copy or a reference of the arguments? Explain with the help of an example.

When `+` operator is used to concatenate two lists in Python, it creates a new list that contains the elements from both lists. 

It does not modify the original lists. This means it makes a copy of the elements from the original lists and combines them into a new list.

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]

new_list = list1 + list2  # Creates a new list

print("Original list1:", list1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print("Original list2:", list2)  # Output: [4, 5, 6]
print("New list:", new_list)     # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

____


Explain the purpose of slicing in Python lists. Provide at least 4 examples to demonstrate slicing operations.

##### Explain the usage any 5 list operating methods with examples. 

* Demonstrate any four functions of lists with the help of an examples.
* Demonstrate any five list functions with the help of an example.
* Exemplify built – in list methods
* Explain the usage of the following methods with examples: i) extend()  ii) pop()  iii) sort()  iv) split()  v) join()

**Answer :**

1. append()   : Adds a single element to the end of the list.
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)

print(my_list)  
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

2. insert()  : Inserts an element at a specific index.
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.insert(1, 4)  # Insert 4 at index 1

print(my_list)  
# Output: [1, 4, 2, 3]
```

3. remove()  : Removes the first occurrence of an element from the list.
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2]
my_list.remove(2)

print(my_list)  
# Output: [1, 3, 2]
```

4. pop()  : Removes and returns the element at the specified index (or the last element if no index is provided).
```python
list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40]

removed_item = my_list.pop(1)   # Remove and return index 1
print(removed_item)
# Output: 20

my_list.pop()  # removed last element
print(my_list)  
# Output: [10, 30]
```

5. `extend()` method is used to add all elements of an iterable (like a list, tuple, set, etc.) to the end of a list. 
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]

list1.extend(list2)  
# Adding elements of list2 to list1

print(list1)  
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

6. `sort()` method is used to sort the elements of a list in ascending order by default. You can also pass a `reverse=True` argument to sort in descending order.
```python
list1 = [3, 1, 4, 2]
list1.sort()
print(list1)
# [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Sort in descending order
list1.sort(reverse=True)
print(list1)  
# [4, 3, 2, 1]
```

The sort() changes the original list in place so does not return the sorted value directly to be printed.

7. `split()` method splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter. If no delimiter is provided, it splits the string at any whitespace by default.

```python
sentence = "Hello World Python"
words = sentence.split()
# Default delimiter is space
print(words)  
# ['Hello', 'World', 'Python']

# Using a custom delimiter
date = "2025-01-25"
parts = date.split('-')
print(parts)  
# Output: ['2025', '01', '25']
```

8. `join()` method is used to join elements of an iterable (like a list, tuple) into a single string, using the string that `join()` is called on as a separator.

```python

words = ['Hello', 'World', 'Python']
sentence = ' '.join(words)
print(sentence)  
# Output: "Hello World Python"


# Join elements with a hyphen
sentence = '-'.join(words)
print(sentence)  
# Output: "Hello-World-Python"
```

##### Develop a python program to print unique elements in a list.

Using Set to remove Duplicates (Shortcut)
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1]
unique_elements = set(my_list)

print( list(unique_elements) )  
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Using Membership Check on List using for loop
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1]

unique = []

for i in my_list:
	if i in unique:
		continue
	else:
		unique.append(i)

print(unique)
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

            indices.append(i)
            
    return indices


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Output: [9, 5, 4, 7, 3, 6, 2, 1]

# 2
scores.insert(3, 8)  # At index 3 Insert 8
print(scores)  
# Output: [9, 5, 4, 8, 7, 3, 6, 2, 1]

# 3
scores.pop()  # Delete last element
print(scores)  
# Output: [9, 5, 4, 8, 7, 3, 6, 2]

# 4
del scores[3]  # Delete element at index 3
print(scores)

>>>lst.insert(3,6)


ii) 
>>>22 > "z"
>>>[1, 2] in [0, 1, 2, 3]
>>>str=“Python programming”
>>>print(str[7:-4])
>>> ls=[34, 'hi', -5]

```
i) not “True”
ii) – 22 % 5
iii) “99” + 1
iv) dir(“python”) v) ['H', 'He', 'Li'] + 'Be'
```

`> not "True"`  Output: `False`,  Non-empty strings are considered `True`. The `not` operator inverts the boolean value, so `not "True"` returns `False`.

`> -22 % 5`  Output: `3` , Modulus operator `%` returns the remainder. The result of `-22 / 5` is `-4` with a remainder of `3`, so `-22 % 5` is `3`.

`> "99" + 1`   Output:  Raises a `TypeError`,  Cannot concatenate a string (`"99"`) with an integer (`1`). Both operands to be of the same type for concatenation.

`> dir("python")`,  Output: A list of attributes and methods associated with string objects.

`> ['H', 'He', 'Li'] + 'Be'` , Output: This will raise a `TypeError`, Cannot concatenate a list with a string directly.

## Dictionaries


Discuss the significance of dictionary. Develop a python program to simulate language dictionary.

##### Demonstrate the creation and operation of dictionaries in Python.

* How do you create and access dictionaries in Python? List and describe any 5 methods on dictionaries.
* List and exemplify the built – in dictionary methods.
* Demonstrate any three functions of dictionaries in python with examples.
* How do you create and access dictionaries in Python? Explain the operations `len()`, `copy()`, `clear()`, `items()` on dictionaries.
* Demonstrate how dictionaries are created and used in Python. List and describe any five methods on dictionaries.
* Demonstrate the usage of update( ) function to update one dictionary with another dictionary.

**Answer :**

Dictionaries are created using curly braces `{}` or the `dict()` constructor. A dictionary stores key-value pairs where each key is unique.
Dictionary values are accessed using keys in square brackets `[]`.

```python
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}

my_dict = dict(name='Alice', age=25, city='New York')

print( my_dict["name"] )
# Alice
```

**Dictionary Operations:**

`len()`  : Returns the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary.
```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

print(len(my_dict))  
# Output: 2
```

`items()` :  Returns a view object that displays a list of tuple pairs (key, value) in the dictionary.
```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

print(my_dict.items())  
# dict_items([('a', 1), ('b', 2)])
```

`copy()` : Returns a shallow copy of the dictionary.
```python
copied_dict = my_dict.copy()

print(copied_dict)  
# {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
```

`clear()` :  Removes all key-value pairs from the dictionary.
```python
my_dict.clear()

print(my_dict)  
# Output: {}
```

`update()` :  Updates the dictionary with elements from another dictionary or iterable of key-value pairs.
```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
my_dict.update({'b': 3, 'c': 4})

print(my_dict)  
# {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```

get()  :  Returns the value for a given key. If the key doesn't exist, it returns `None` or a specified default value.
```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

print(my_dict.get('a'))  
# Output: 1

print(my_dict.get('c', 'Not found'))  
# Output: Not found
```

pop()  : Removes and returns the value associated with a given key.
```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
popped_value = my_dict.pop('b')

print(popped_value)  
# Output: 2

print(my_dict)
# Output: {'a': 1}
```
