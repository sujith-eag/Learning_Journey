##### Write a program using a while loop that asks the user for a number, and prints a countdown from that number to zero.

```python
>>> while True:
...     num = int(input("Num : "))
...     for i in range(num, 0, -1):
...             print(i)
... 
Num : 7
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```

___

##### Develop a program to print the sum of n natural numbers.

```python
>>> n = 10
>>> total = 0
>>> for i in range(n+1):
...     total += i
... 
>>> total
55
```

___

##### Develop a python program to find the sum of even numbers and odd numbers in the given list.

```python
>>> list_1 = [1,2,3,5,7,8,9,11,12,15,13]
>>> even = 0
>>> odd = 0
>>> 
>>> for i in list_1:
...     if( i % 2== 0):
...             even += i
...     else:
...             odd+=i
... 
>>> even, odd
(22, 64)
```

___

##### Develop a python program to sum the digits of a given number.

```python
>>> num = 45743
>>> total = 0
>>> while num > 0:
...     digit = num % 10
...     total += digit
...     num = num // 10
... 
>>> total
23
```

Shortcut with string to iterate using for loop
```python
>>> num = 45743
>>> num_str = str(num)
>>> total = 0
>>> for i in num_str:
...     total += int(i)
... 
>>> total
23
```

____

##### Write a program to count the total number of digits and sum of digits in a number using a while loop.

```python
>> num = 456323445334
>>> count = 0
>>> digit_sum = 0
>>> 
>>> while num > 0:
...     digit = num % 10   # Get the last digit
...     digit_sum += digit  # Add the digit to the sum
...     count += 1    # Increase the digit count
...     num //= 10    # Remove the last digit
... 
>>> count, digit_sum
(12, 46)
```


String Cheat method
```python
>>> num = 456323445334
>>> num_str = str(num)
>>> count = 0
>>> total = 0
>>> while count < len(num_str):
...     total += int(num_str[count])    
...     count+= 1
... 
>>> count, total
(12, 46)
```

##### Implement a Python Program to reverse a number and also find the number of digits and Sum of digits in the reversed number. Prompt the user for input.

Logic to reverse Number
```python
>>> num = 45743
>>> rev = 0
>>> while num>0:
...     digit = num % 10  # Get the last digit
...     rev = rev*10 + digit  # increment and add
...     num = num // 10  # remove last number
... 
>>> rev
34754
```

```python
>>> num = 456323445334
>>> rev_num = 0
>>> count = 0
>>> total = 0
>>> 
>>> while num > 0:
...     count += 1
...     digit = num%10
...     total += digit
...     rev_num = rev_num*10 + digit
...     num = num // 10
... 
>>> rev_num, count, total
(433544323654, 12, 46)
```

String Cheat Methods
```python
>>> num = 456323445334
>>> num_str = str(num)
>>> count = len(num_str)
>>> rev_num = int(num_str[::-1])
>>> 
>>> total = 0
>>> for i in num_str:
...     total += int(i)
... 
>>> count, rev_num, total
(12, 433544323654, 46)
```

___

##### Design a program to print the mid number (which is between minimum and maximum) out of three input numbers

Design a Python program to find the average of best two test scores out of three test scores taken as input.

```python
>>> a, b, c = 3, 6, 5
>>> 
>>> if (b < a < c ) or ( c < a < b ):
...     print(a)
... elif(a < b < c ) or ( c < b < a):
...     print(b)
... else:
...     print(c)
... 
5
```

Using list, sort and indexing
```python
>>> a, b, c = 3, 6, 5
>>> 
>>> num = [a,b,c]
>>> num.sort()
>>> num[1]
5
```

___

##### Write a Python program to count the palindrome words in a line of text.

```python
>>> text = "Madam the racecar and the level of civic duty were admired by the radar"
>>> words = text.split(" ")
>>> palindrome = 0
>>> 
>>> for word in words:
...     w = word.lower()
...     if(w == w[::-1]):
...             palindrome += 1
... 
>>> palindrome
5
```

___
