### Inline Assignment Using the Walrus Operator (from Python 3.8 onwards)

In **C**:
```c
while( (n = get_number()) != -1 )
```

In **Python**:
```python
while ( (n := len(my_list)) > 10 ):
```

____

The **walrus operator** (`:=`) introduced in Python 3.8 provides a way to perform **inline assignments** within expressions, allowing you to assign a value to a variable and use it in a single expression. This can be particularly useful in loops, conditionals, and comprehensions, making the code more concise and readable.

### Comparison with C

In C, it's common to use inline assignments in `while` loops, like this:

```c
while( (n = get_number()) != -1 )
```

This is equivalent to assigning the result of `get_number()` to `n` and then checking whether it’s not equal to `-1`.

### Python Equivalent Using the Walrus Operator

In Python, with the walrus operator (`:=`), you can achieve a similar effect of assigning a value within an expression, particularly in loops and conditions.

#### Example 1: Using Walrus in a While Loop

Let's say you want to keep getting a number until the user enters `-1`. You can use the walrus operator to both get the number and check if it's not `-1` in a single line.

```python
# Example Python script to use the walrus operator
# You can run this directly in the terminal.

while (n := int(input("Enter a number (-1 to exit): "))) != -1:
    print(f"Received number: {n}")
print("Exited loop.")
```

### How it works:

- **Inline Assignment:** `n := int(input(...))` performs the assignment and comparison in a single line.
- **Loop Termination:** The loop continues as long as `n` is not `-1`.

### Example 2: Using Walrus in a `while` Loop with a Function

You can also use the walrus operator in more complex scenarios like when you're reading data from a function or an API.

```python
def get_data():
    # Simulate fetching some data (e.g., from a file, user input, etc.)
    return input("Enter a string (empty to exit): ")

# Run the loop until the input is empty
while (data := get_data()) != "":
    print(f"Received: {data}")
print("Exited loop.")
```

### Explanation:

- The function `get_data()` retrieves input from the user, and the walrus operator assigns that input to `data` while simultaneously checking if it’s an empty string to exit the loop.

### Example 3: List Comprehension with Inline Assignment

The walrus operator can also be used in list comprehensions to make the code more compact and efficient.

```python
# Example: Extract non-empty words from a sentence

sentence = "This is a Python example demonstrating the walrus operator"
words = sentence.split()

# Using the walrus operator to filter and capitalize non-empty words
capitalized_words = [word.capitalize() for word in words if (length := len(word)) > 2]

print(capitalized_words)  # Output: ['This', 'Is', 'Python', 'Example', 'Demonstrating', 'The', 'Walrus', 'Operator']
```

### How it works:

- **Inline Assignment:** `(length := len(word))` assigns the length of each word to the variable `length`.
- **Filtering:** The list comprehension includes only words whose length is greater than `2`.

### Example 4: Reading Large Data in Chunks

You can use the walrus operator to read large files or streams in chunks and process them efficiently.

```python
# Example: Reading a large file in chunks and processing the chunks

def read_chunk():
    # Simulate reading a chunk of data
    return "chunk of data"  # Replace with actual file reading logic

while (chunk := read_chunk()) != "":  # Continue until an empty chunk
    print(f"Processing: {chunk}")
print("Done reading chunks.")
```

### Explanation:

- **Inline Assignment:** `(chunk := read_chunk())` reads a chunk of data from the function `read_chunk()`.
- **Loop Condition:** The loop continues until an empty string is returned, indicating the end of the data.

### Use Cases for the Walrus Operator

1. **Reducing Repetition in Loops**: Avoids repeating the same expression multiple times within a loop or conditional.
2. **More Concise Code**: Makes code more compact and avoids redundant lines by combining assignment and evaluation.
3. **Efficiency in Data Processing**: Especially useful when processing streams of data, allowing inline assignments while checking conditions (e.g., reading from files, APIs, or handling user input).
4. **Improved Readability**: It makes the code more readable when the assignment is part of the condition, without requiring additional lines or variables.

### Example 5: Using Walrus with File I/O

Another scenario is when you're reading from a file or network stream and you want to process chunks of data.

```python
# Simulating reading from a file
with open("sample.txt", "r") as f:
    while (line := f.readline()):
        print(f"Processing line: {line.strip()}")

print("Done processing.")
```

### Explanation:

- The walrus operator assigns the result of `f.readline()` to `line` and simultaneously checks if the line is non-empty. The loop continues as long as lines are being read.

### Benefits of the Walrus Operator

- **Conciseness:** You can combine assignment and condition in a single line, reducing the need for separate assignment statements.
- **Improved Readability:** In some cases, it improves readability by making it clear that the assignment is part of the condition.
- **Performance:** In some cases, it can avoid recalculating a value (e.g., in list comprehensions), improving performance.

### Conclusion

The **walrus operator (`:=`)** is a powerful tool in Python that makes code more concise and readable. It is useful when you need to both **assign a value and check it** in a single expression, especially in loops, comprehensions, and conditional statements. It’s especially handy in **while loops** and when processing data in chunks, such as reading user input or data from files.
