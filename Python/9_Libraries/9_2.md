command-line arguments
# is a feature allows providing arguments or input to the program while executing the program
# the words typed after the file while executing gets passed on as arguments without having to be prompted

sys   # deals with program itself

sys.argv  # is a variable that exists in sys, called arg v, argument vector
# argument vector means list of all the words a human typed in at their prompt before hitting enter

argv is a list[],

# the second element at [1] is going to be the typed data

import sys

# there is a way to get only few "slice" of argv, taking a subset of a data structure or a list Specifying where we will start and end of the list

# sys.argv[1 : ]  1 means starting at second element [1], and blank means going to the end
import sys
if len(sys.argv) <2:              
    sys.exit("too few arguments")
for name in sys.argv[ 1: ]:

# [] at end of list can not just be used to go to a specific element like [1], [0], [2] but use [ : ] to specify the start and end of the list to be taken [0 : ] [2:4]  blank means beginning or end

# taking the slices [1 : -1]  removes the last one, counting one less from the end

### Command-Line Arguments in Python

**Command-line arguments** are a feature that allows users to provide input to a program directly while executing it, without the need for prompting. These arguments are passed in the terminal (or command prompt) when the program is executed.

For example, if you run a Python script and pass additional values after the script name, those values are captured as arguments that can be accessed by your program. This allows the program to act based on the data or input provided at runtime.

---

### Using `sys.argv` to Handle Command-Line Arguments

In Python, the `sys` module provides functions and variables that interact with the system. One of the most useful features for handling command-line arguments is `sys.argv`.

- **`sys.argv`** is a list that stores the arguments passed to the Python script from the command line.
- **`sys.argv[0]`** is always the name of the Python script.
- **`sys.argv[1]`** and beyond represent the arguments typed after the script name.

#### Example 1: Basic Command-Line Arguments

```python
import sys

# Access the first argument passed to the script (excluding the script name)
print("Hello, my name is", sys.argv[1])
```

#### Explanation:

- `sys.argv` is a list. `sys.argv[0]` contains the script's name, and `sys.argv[1]` contains the first argument passed by the user.
- If no arguments are provided, an **IndexError** occurs because `sys.argv[1]` will be out of range.

---

### Handling Errors with Try-Except

To avoid errors when the user doesn't pass the expected arguments, you can use **exceptions**.

#### Example 2: Handling `IndexError` with Try-Except

```python
import sys

try:
    # Try to access the first argument
    print("Hello, my name is", sys.argv[1])
except IndexError:
    # If the argument is missing, catch the error and display a message
    print("Too few arguments")
```

#### Explanation:

- If the user doesn't provide any arguments, the program raises an **IndexError**, which is caught by the `except` block. This allows you to display a friendly message instead of crashing.

---

### Using `len()` to Check Argument Length

You can also check the number of arguments using the `len()` function to determine whether the user provided the right number of arguments.

#### Example 3: Checking Argument Length

```python
import sys

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    print("Too few arguments")
elif len(sys.argv) > 2:
    print("Too many arguments")
else:
    print("Hello, my name is", sys.argv[1])
```

#### Explanation:

- `len(sys.argv)` returns the total number of arguments passed to the script, including the script name. The program checks if it has fewer or more arguments than expected.
- This approach allows you to handle cases where the user has provided too few or too many arguments.

---

### Handling Multiple Arguments

When you want to accept more than one argument, you can pass multiple words or names when running the script. If the user enters multiple values, they will be treated as separate elements in the `sys.argv` list.

#### Example 4: Accepting Multiple Arguments

```python
import sys

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    sys.exit("Too few arguments")

for name in sys.argv[1:]:
    print("Hello, my name is", name)
```

#### Explanation:

- This code accepts any number of names passed after the script name. The program loops through all arguments (except the script name) and prints each one.
- The slice `sys.argv[1:]` means "take all arguments starting from the second one" (skipping the script name).

---

### Using `sys.exit()` for Early Program Termination

To exit the program early when there are too few or too many arguments, you can use `sys.exit()`. This function not only prints an error message but also terminates the program immediately.

#### Example 5: Exiting on Invalid Arguments

```python
import sys

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    sys.exit("Too few arguments")
elif len(sys.argv) > 2:
    sys.exit("Too many arguments")

print("Hello, my name is", sys.argv[1])
```

#### Explanation:

- If the number of arguments is not exactly what you expect, the program will exit immediately with an appropriate message.

---

### Slicing `sys.argv` to Handle Specific Arguments

Sometimes you may only need a specific portion of the arguments. You can use **list slicing** to extract a subset of arguments from `sys.argv`.

#### Example 6: Using Slicing on `sys.argv`

```python
import sys

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    sys.exit("Too few arguments")

# Print all arguments except the script name
for name in sys.argv[1:]:
    print("Hello, my name is", name)
```

#### Explanation:

- **Slicing**: `sys.argv[1:]` takes all elements from index `1` (the first argument passed) to the end of the list.
- **Other slicing examples**:
    - `sys.argv[0:]` – Takes all elements, including the script name.
    - `sys.argv[:3]` – Takes the first three arguments.
    - `sys.argv[1:-1]` – Takes all arguments except the first and last.

---

### Handling Arguments as Full Names or Phrases

If the user enters a full name with spaces (like "John Doe"), it will be split into multiple arguments by default. However, you can handle full names with spaces by combining arguments or using quotes when passing them.

#### Example 7: Handling Full Names

```python
import sys

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    sys.exit("Too few arguments")

# Join all arguments (except the script name) into a single string
full_name = " ".join(sys.argv[1:])
print("Hello, my name is", full_name)
```

#### Explanation:

- The `join()` method combines all arguments into a single string, allowing you to print the full name even if it contains spaces.
- The user can type their full name in quotes (e.g., `python script.py "John Doe"`) to pass it as a single argument.

---

### Conclusion

- **Command-line arguments** are a powerful feature in Python that allows the program to accept input directly from the terminal.
- Use the **`sys.argv`** list to access arguments passed to the script, with `sys.argv[0]` being the script name and `sys.argv[1]` onwards being the user-provided arguments.
- Handle common errors like **IndexError** and **ValueError** using **try-except** blocks to ensure robustness.
- Use **`sys.exit()`** to terminate the program early with an error message if the arguments don't match expectations.
- **List slicing** (e.g., `sys.argv[1:]`) is useful for handling a subset of arguments, and **`join()`** allows you to process multiple arguments as a single value, such as a full name.

By understanding and using these techniques, you can create more flexible and user-friendly Python programs that can handle inputs dynamically during execution.
