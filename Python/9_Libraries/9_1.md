## Python Modules, Libraries, and Functions

In Python, **modules** are files containing reusable pieces of code that you or others can use in your programs. A module can include functions, variables, and classes that you can import and use in your own code. Modules are helpful because they allow you to organize code and share functionality without having to rewrite it every time.

### **What is a Module?**

A module is simply a Python file (`.py`) that contains functions and variables. It might be a file you’ve written, or it might be an external file provided by Python or third-party libraries.

When you use a **module** in your Python program, you are effectively reusing code that’s been written in a different file.

For example, Python comes with a standard library of modules, including one called `random`, which is used to generate random numbers and perform random selections.

### **Importing Modules**

In Python, you can import a module into your script using the `import` keyword. This gives you access to the functions and variables defined in the module.

```python
import random
```

After importing the `random` module, you can access all of its functions by typing `random.function_name()`.

### **Using the `random` Module**

#### **Example 1: Choosing Random Items**

The `random.choice()` function randomly selects an item from a sequence (like a list). Here's an example where we randomly select between "heads" and "tails" for a coin flip:

```python
import random

# Choose a random item from the list
coin = random.choice(["heads", "tails"])  # Randomly chooses between "heads" and "tails"
print(coin)
```

#### **Explanation:**

- `random.choice(seq)` selects a random item from the sequence `seq` (which can be a list, tuple, etc.).
- In this case, `random.choice(["heads", "tails"])` randomly selects one of the two values.

---

#### **Example 2: Importing Specific Functions**

Sometimes, you may only want to import a specific function from a module instead of the whole module. You can do this using the `from` keyword:

```python
from random import choice

# Use the imported 'choice' function directly
coin = choice(["heads", "tails"])
print(coin)
```

This way, you can use `choice()` without prefixing it with `random.`.

---

#### **Example 3: Generating Random Integers**

The `random.randint(a, b)` function generates a random integer between `a` and `b` (inclusive).

```python
import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive)
random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
print(random_number)
```

---

#### **Example 4: Shuffling a List**

The `random.shuffle()` function randomly reorders the items in a list. Note that `shuffle()` modifies the list **in place** and does not return a new list.

```python
import random

# List of cards
cards = ["king", "jack", "queen", "joker"]

# Shuffle the cards list
random.shuffle(cards)

# Print the shuffled cards
for card in cards:
    print(card)
```

Here, the `cards` list will be shuffled, and the output will display the shuffled order.

---

### **Using the `statistics` Module**

Python also provides a `statistics` module for working with statistics like averages, variances, and standard deviations. You can use it to perform common statistical calculations on data.

#### **Example: Calculating the Mean**

```python
import statistics

# List of numbers
numbers = [100, 90, 85, 95]

# Calculate the mean (average) of the list
mean_value = statistics.mean(numbers)
print(mean_value)
```

---

### **Importing Functions from Your Own Modules**

You can also import functions from your own files. When you write functions in separate files, you can organize your code better and make it reusable in multiple programs. Let’s look at an example.

#### **Creating a File with Functions (e.g., `my_module.py`)**

```python
# my_module.py

def hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

def goodbye(name):
    print(f"Goodbye, {name}!")
```

Now you can import these functions in another file and use them.

#### **Using Functions from Another File**

```python
# main.py

# Import specific functions from my_module.py
from my_module import hello, goodbye

def main():
    hello("world")  # Calls the hello function
    goodbye("world")  # Calls the goodbye function

if __name__ == "__main__":  # Ensures the main function only runs when the script is executed directly
    main()
```

#### **Explanation:**

- The `from my_module import hello, goodbye` statement imports the `hello` and `goodbye` functions from the `my_module.py` file.
- `if __name__ == "__main__":` ensures that `main()` only runs if `main.py` is executed directly, not if it's imported as a module.

---

### **The Role of `__name__` and `__main__`**

When you run a Python file directly, the `__name__` variable is automatically set to `"__main__"`. This allows you to conditionally execute code in a file only when it’s run directly, not when it’s imported as a module.

#### **Example with `__name__`**

```python
# main.py

def hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello("world")  # This will only run if the file is executed directly
```

When you run `main.py`, `hello("world")` will be called. However, if you import `main.py` into another file, the `hello()` function will be available, but `hello("world")` will not automatically be called.

---

### **Using Command-Line Arguments**

You can also use the `sys.argv` list to pass arguments to your script from the command line. Here's how you can use it in conjunction with your imported functions.

#### **Example with Command-Line Arguments**

```python
import sys
from my_module import hello

if len(sys.argv) == 2:  # Check if one argument (apart from the script name) is passed
    hello(sys.argv[1])  # Pass the argument to the hello function
```

If you run this program from the command line and pass an argument (e.g., `python main.py John`), it will print `"Hello, John!"`.

---

### **Avoiding Running Code on Import: `__name__ == "__main__"`**

When you run a Python script, it automatically executes top-to-bottom. This can be an issue if you want to import the script as a module in another file but avoid running parts of it immediately. To prevent this, you use `if __name__ == "__main__":`.

#### **Example: Avoiding Code Execution on Import**

```python
# main.py

def hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

def main():
    hello("world")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()  # Only runs if the script is executed directly
```

Now, if you import this file into another script, the `main()` function won’t run automatically.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Modules** allow you to organize and reuse code in Python.
- Use **`import`** to bring external or internal functions into your program.
- **`from ... import ...`** allows you to import specific functions or classes.
- **Randomization** can be done using Python’s built-in `random` module (e.g., `choice()`, `shuffle()`, `randint()`).
- Python has built-in **statistics** and other modules that you can use to perform calculations.
- **`__name__ == "__main__"`** is useful for running code only when a script is executed directly.
- You can pass command-line arguments using **`sys.argv`** to make your script interactive.

By understanding and leveraging these concepts, you can create more efficient, modular, and flexible Python programs.
