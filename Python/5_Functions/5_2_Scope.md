If a variable is defined inside a function, it cannot be accessed outside its scope.


**Function Calls and Scope Issues**

The `main()` function prompts for a name and calls another function to process it.

```python
# Defining and calling functions
def main():
    name = input("What's your name? ")    
    hello(name)

def hello(to="world"):
    print("Hello,", to)

main()
```

```python
# Scope issue example
def main():
    name = input("What's your name? ")    
    hello()

def hello():  # No parameter defined
    print("Hello,", name)  # Error: name is not defined in this function

main()
```

Since `name` is local to `main()`, `hello()` cannot access it directly.

Issue of "Scope" which refers to a variable only existing in the context it was defined in. `name` was defined in `main()` so it cannot be used directly in `hello()`.
When the value is handed to `hello()` within the `main()`, it can be used.
Its for each function to name its own variable so the "name" variable in main can be passed to "hello" which becomes "to"

Returning values allows functions to pass data back.

```python
# Returning values between functions
def main():
    x = int(input("What's x? "))
    print("Value of x squared is:", square(x))

def square(n):
    return n * n  # Returns the squared value

main()
```

## Scope in Functions

### Local vs. Global Scope

Variables inside a function are separate from those outside.

```python
# Scope demonstration
def f():
    y = x
    print(y)

x = 7  # Global variable
f()  # Runs fine
```

If a variable is defined inside the function, it does not check the external definition:

```python
# Local scope overriding global
def f():
    y = x  # Error: x is referenced before assignment
    print(y)
    x = 22  # Local x is defined after usage

x = 7
f()
```
in first case, there is no x inside the function so it checks outside.
this applies only to immutable values.

### Global Variables and Mutability

Lists and dictionaries are mutable and can be updated globally.

```python
# Modifying a global mutable variable

def f():
    y = x[0]
    print(y)
    x[0] = 22  # Modifies global list

x = [7]  # x is a list
f()  # Prints 7 and updates x
```

### Modifying Global Immutable Variables

To modify global immutable variables, `global` must be declared.

```python
# Using global to modify immutable variables
def f():
    global x  # Declare global usage
    y = x
    print(y)
    x = 22  # Modifies global x

x = 7
f()  # Prints 7, updates x to 22
print(x)  # Output: 22
```

## Nested Functions

A function can be defined inside another function called "helper" function. 

```python
# Nested functions example
def f():
    def g(a):
        return a + 1
    
    def h(b):
        return 2 * b
    
    global x
    y = g(x) + h(x)
    print(y)
    x = 22

x = 7
f()
```

Here, `g()` and `h()` are only accessible within `f()`. Nested functions are useful for encapsulating helper logic within a function.

### **Global Keyword**

The `global` keyword in Python allows you to modify a variable defined outside a function from within the function. Without using `global`, a variable inside a function would be considered local, and changes to it wouldn't affect the global variable.

```python
x = 5

def modify_global():
    global x
    x = 10  # This modifies the global variable 'x'

modify_global()
print(x)  # Output: 10
```

- The `global x` statement inside the function tells Python to modify the global `x` variable, not a local one.
- After calling `modify_global()`, the value of `x` is updated to `10`.

### **Passing a Group of Elements to a Function**

To pass multiple elements (such as a list of numbers) to a function, you can group them together in a list or another collection type and pass that collection to the function.

##### **Example: Passing a List to a Function**

```python
def process_numbers(lst):
    total = sum(lst)
    print("Total:", total)

numbers = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
process_numbers(numbers)
```

- The `process_numbers()` function accepts a list of numbers, calculates the total sum, and prints it.
- The list `numbers` is created by reading space-separated input values, converting them to integers, and passing the list to the function.

This approach is flexible and can be adapted to process any group of data.
