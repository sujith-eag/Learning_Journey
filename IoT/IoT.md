Arduino IDE: The Arduino Software (IDE) runs on Windows, Macintosh OSX, and Linux operating systems. Most microcontroller systems are limited to Windows. The Arduino software is a open source tools, The language can be expanded through C++ libraries.

Python: Scripting Language, It's free Complete Object-Oriented, Portable. A broad standard library, Mixes good features from Java, Perl and scheme, Easy to use and Learn, supports databases.

Java: features that make JAVA favorable for the Internet of Things (IoT) Development is Write Once, Run Anywhere, Object Oriented, extensive built-in library, highly interoperable.

Golang: open-source statically typed programming language, ability for the maximum usage of the hardware that makes it more compatible and relevant for the IoT development.
