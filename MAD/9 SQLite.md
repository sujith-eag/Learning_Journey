### SQLite Overview

**SQLite** is a self-contained, full-featured, embedded relational database management system. Unlike traditional databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL that operate on a client-server model, SQLite runs within the application itself, requiring no separate server process. It is designed for simplicity and efficiency, making it ideal for small to medium-sized applications, mobile apps, and for use in development environments.

#### Key Features

- **Self-Contained**: SQLite is a lightweight database that requires minimal setup. It is encapsulated within a single cross-platform file (commonly with extensions `.db` or `.sqlite3`).
  
- **Embedded**: As an embedded database, SQLite integrates directly into the application, allowing for high performance and reduced complexity.

- **Cross-Platform**: The database file can be copied between systems with different architectures and operating systems without modification.

- **Data Types**: SQLite supports various data types, which include:
  - **INTEGER**: A signed integer.
  - **TEXT**: A string.
  - **REAL**: A floating-point value.
  - **BLOB**: A binary large object.
  - **NULL**: A NULL value.

- **Constraints**: You can define constraints such as:
  - **NOT NULL (NN)**: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
  - **PRIMARY KEY (PK)**: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
  - **AUTO INCREMENT**: Automatically generates a unique value for each new row.
  - **UNIQUE (U)**: Ensures that all values in a column are distinct.

#### Relationships

To establish relationships between tables, you can use **foreign keys**. A foreign key in one table points to a primary key in another table, allowing for relational integrity. 

For example, if you have a `users` table and a `posts` table, the `posts` table might include a `user_id` column that references the `id` column of the `users` table.

**Creating a Relationship**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE posts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

### Query Structure

Queries in SQLite follow standard SQL syntax. Here are some basic examples:

- **Select Data**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users;
  ```

- **Insert Data**:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('John Doe');
  ```

- **Update Data**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE users SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 1;
  ```

- **Delete Data**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
  ```

### Tools for SQLite

To interact with SQLite databases, you can use various clients, including:

- **Command Line Interface**: SQLite comes with a command-line tool that allows you to run SQL commands directly.
  
- **GUI Tools**:
  - **DB Browser for SQLite**: A visual tool for creating, designing, and editing SQLite database files.
  - **SQLiteStudio**: A user-friendly SQLite database manager.
  - **DBeaver Community**: A universal database management tool that supports various databases, including SQLite.
