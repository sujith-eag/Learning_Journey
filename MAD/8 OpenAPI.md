prefer Design-first instead of Code-first
Single source of truth
	a structure which can be read by humans and machines
	The structure of the code should be derived from the OAS
	or the spec should be derived from the code.
	Minimize the chances of code and documentation diverging

Open API is open public documentation so better to identify problems
