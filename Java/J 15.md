generics added a completely new syntax element and caused changes to many of
the classes and methods in the core API. It is not an overstatement to say that the inclusion of
generics fundamentally reshaped the character of Java.
The topic of generics is quite large, and some of it is sufficiently advanced.

However, a basic understanding of generics is necessary for all Java
programmers. At first glance, the generics syntax may look a bit intimidating, but don’t worry.
Generics are surprisingly simple to use.
