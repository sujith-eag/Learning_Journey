(`;` didn't work as intended because all are options, not separate statements)

`ls -l; ls-a; ls -la;` is separate statements linked.


### Long listing

`ls -l` used for long listing the details of files and directories.
`ls -l file.txt` for details of that file
The file types and permissions are combined together to form 10 characters.
`drwxr-xr-x` 
`-r-xr-xr-x`
the first `d` represents a directory and `-` are files.

```bash
sujith@sujith-Latitude-7490:~/Desktop$ ls -l
total 24
drwxrwxr-x 4 sujith sujith 4096 Sep  3 15:29  courses
drwxr-xr-x 2 sujith sujith 4096 Dec 22 16:11 'MCA Sem1 Text Books'
