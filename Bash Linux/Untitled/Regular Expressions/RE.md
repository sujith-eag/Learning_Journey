A regular expression (regex) is a string that expresses a pattern.
Contains combination of literal characters and meta-characters.
The meta-characters modify the literal characters to provide variability.

The result is that a regex can match more than just a literal string.
regex are used to search for strings for pattern of interest.

`"aeiou"` matches only a string. 
`"[aeiou]{5}"` this regex will match any string of vowels in lower case (word with five consecutive vowels in any order) using `pattern matching`

Wild cards allow one way to express patterns, but regex allow for expressing more complex patterns. Some wild card characters are used but their usage differs.


### Metacharacters

The regex of Linux was adopted from POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface for Unix) which was the series of standards that OS developers should impliment to ensure `Unix or Unix like` OS shared features.

Original metacharacters described by POSIX make up the `basic regularexpression` set.
Later `extended regular expression` was defined by POSIX with same set of metacharacters but without the `\` for some characters.
