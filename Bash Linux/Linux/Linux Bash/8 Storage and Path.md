## Storage terminology

File space is the physical collection of storage devices combined to make up the locations of all files and directories.
the files and folders are `logical` view of the file space.

We can view the file space as devices, partitions, mountings and breakdown of the files into their disk block. This is the physical view of the file space.

Os have commands to show both the views but we prefer to see by the logical view.

`file` represents the smallest logical unit within the file space.
Files themselves are stored as a collection of disk blocks.
blocks of a single file are not necessarily stored `contiguously` on disk but instead scattered across one or more disk surfaces.
`file` have properties, like filename. (letters, numbers and `_` )

`directories` are a way to organize files. sub-directories create a hierarchical file space.

Linux has a pre-established set of directories referred to as `top-level directories`.

we will be in `current working directory`.
accessing files in another directory needs specifying a directory path.

`absolute path` always starts from the root directory.
`relative path` describes the change from where we are to where we want to go.

Directories are grouped together into partitions.
`partition` is the physical division of the collection of storage devices into independent units.

For backing up, we can unmount a specific partition containing that content and while unmounted, no one can access it. Other partitions will not be affected.

Logical volume manager(LVM) is an alternative to physical partitioning, it does not restrict any partition growth. But few disadvantages as a overhead to disk access. also the problem with loading the `kernel` files of Linux

Linux offers three separate partitions: `/boot`, `LVM` and `swap`
`/boot` must be separated from `LVM` and also `swap` as swap space (virtual memory) is treated differently from rest of the file space and not directly accessed by the user.

***inode***
`inode` is additional component of `Linux file space`
`inode` is a data structure which stores file information (meta-data) and pointers to the various file blocks on disk.
`inode` is dedicated to every file, directory and symbolic link in the file space.
the information it stores includes the file's type, owner, group, permissions and last access/create/modification date.

Another one is `link`,
`link` is a pointer which points from a file in a directory to its `inode` which contains pointers to point at the files's physical blocks.

There are two types of links, 
`hard link` points directly at the file's `inode`.
`soft link` or `symbolic link` points at a hard link.

For a symbolic link, the first character of a symbolic link, in the permission is `l`.
and the name is indicated as `link -> file` where `link` is the symbolic link and the `file` is the item being pointed at. The file will be in another directory.

The hard link's type is not `l` but it will be the type of the file being pointed to, that is `-` for a regular file and `d` for a directory.
The name is the `links` name and there is no `->` or separate `file` name.
The hard link count is greater than one.

When a file has a single pointer pointing to it, its hard link count is one.  
greater than one indicates more than one link to that item. all Directories have count of at least 2.


***The top level structure***
All distros contain a minimum `/boot` `/dev` `/etc` `/home` `/proc` `/var` and `/usr`.
Some directories will have pre-established internal structure.

### Relative and Absolute Paths


A path is a description of how to reach a particular location in the file location. is is needed when the file is not in the present working directory.
Path can be absolute or relative.

The path can be omitted for executable files if the file is stored in our `PATH` variable.

`absolute path` always starts from the root level of file space (`/`) and specifies each directory from there to the location of interest, separating each by `/`.
The correct notation is to end the directory name with `/`. but for a directory it can be omitted.
`/home/foxr/temp`

`relative path` describes the change from where we are (working directory) to where we want to go.
The relative path does not start with `/`, it should not.  (`/` in beginning should start from root, home)
`../xaps/dir`  moving up and down.
- **Relative paths** are used with commands like `ls` and `cd` to find locations based on the current directory location.  'from where we are' rather than from the root of the file system.  So it can only look at files within that directory and the `..` parent directory


#### Filename arguments with Paths

`./` indicates the current directory when multiple directories are being passed as argument.

#### `PATH` variable

The environment variable we have is `PATH` which has the paths to various directories that might contain executable programs.  `cat, ls, cd` are all in `user/bin`

```bash
/home/sujith/.nvm/versions/node/v20.17.0/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/snap/bin
```
We can modify `PATH` using assignment statement.
Value for it can include the variable's value itself that is `$PATH`.
Contents of it are list of directories separated by `:`
To add to the path we can `PATH=$PATH:new_directory`  or `PATH=new_directory:$PATH`.

It makes sense to have the most commonly used directories listed earlier.

#### Specifying filenames with wildcards

`ls *` is same as `ls`
`ls *.txt`  `ls f*.txt`   `ls f*.*`
The bash interpreter performs the filename expansion or `globbing` prior to the execution.

`*` Match with everything
`?` match any one character
`[chars]` match any one character in the list  `[aeiou]`   one `[]` is for one character only.
	`ls [abc][abc][abc]`
`[char1-char2]` match any one of the character in the range. `[0-9] [a-e] [A-Z]`
`{word1,word2,word3}` match any one of the words   
	`file?.{dat,txt}`  `{aa,file1,mystuff,target}.txt`
`[!chars]`  match any one character not in the list   `ls [!a]*` first character not `a`
