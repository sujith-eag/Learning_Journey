### ***What is an Operating System?***

An **Operating System (OS)** is a collection of programs that work together as a whole to support the user’s interaction with the computer by managing hardware resources and running processes. 

Operating systems typically comprise many different programs, with the heart of the OS being a single program called the **kernel**.

- The **kernel** is loaded into memory when the computer boots and remains resident in memory until the system shuts down. 
- Its role is to handle process and resource management, among other tasks. 
- The kernel may call upon other OS components to complete certain tasks, which are loaded and run as needed.
- Users may also call upon some of these OS components, which are also loaded and run as needed.

### ***The Operating System Kernel***

The **kernel** is responsible for most of the important tasks of the OS. There are three primary types of kernels:

1. **Monolithic Kernel**
2. **Microkernel**
3. **Hybrid Kernel**

#### **Monolithic Kernel**

A **monolithic kernel** is a single program that operates solely within the computer’s privileged mode and its own memory(address) space. 

- Communication between the user space (running applications) and the kernel space is done via **system calls**.
- A **system call** invokes a specific portion of the OS kernel. Upon receiving a system call, the kernel switches from user mode to privileged mode.
- The kernel ensures that the user’s request is legitimate and that the appropriate access level is granted for the request to be carried.

- **Early Operating Systems** used a monolithic kernel, which was small due to limited memory and fewer system resources. As computing capabilities grew, operating systems became more complex, and so did their kernels.

#### **Microkernel**

In a **microkernel**:
- The kernel is smaller and simpler than the monolithic type.
- Communication is similar to the monolithic kernel, but the kernel relies on **servers** to handle various tasks.
- System calls occur between the kernel and servers, as well as between application software and servers.

Among the server components are: 
**File system servers**, **Network servers**, **Display servers**,  **User interface servers**, **Device driver communication servers**

The kernel retains responsibility for:
**Process scheduling**, **Memory management** (including virtual memory), **Interprocess communication** between OS components.

---

#### **Hybrid Kernel**

The **hybrid kernel** is a compromise between monolithic and microkernels. 
The kernel is kept small, but additional server-like components are added:
- Server components run in kernel mode but typically in the user’s address space.
- This allows processes to call upon the servers more easily than in the microkernel approach, bypassing some time-consuming system calls.

---

### **Linux Kernel:**

- **Modular Monolithic Kernel**: Monolithic kernels can be broken into modules, which are loaded as needed. This modular approach allows Linux to remain lightweight based on the modules loaded.
- **Linux and System Calls**: In Linux, a system call isn’t directly intercepted by the kernel. Instead, it’s handled by a **wrapper function**, which places the arguments of the function call into appropriate hardware registers before the kernel switches from user mode to privileged mode.
- **Portability**: Linux is a portable OS. It is not written for any specific hardware but can run on various platforms.

### ***Roles of OS Kernel***

| **Role**                | **Meaning**                                                                 | **Example**                                  |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Auditing and Accounting** | Keep track of users logged in and resources allocated; log events.           | Auditing and logging programs.               |
| **Device Management**   | Ability to add, remove, and interface with peripheral devices.              | Mounting disk drives, adding devices via USB.|
| **File Management**     | Ability to manage files and directories: open, close, create, save, rename, and copy. | File operations like opening, creating, renaming files. |
| **Interprocess Communication** | Sharing information between running processes.                              | Signals and message-passing between processes.|
| **Interrupt Handling**  | Handling device interrupts and running situations.                          | Timer interrupts, I/O interrupts, interprocess interrupts. |
| **Memory Management**   | Allocation and deallocation of memory; protecting memory areas.             | Virtual memory, demand paging, memory compaction. |
| **Process Management**  | Starting new processes, monitoring running processes, and handling errors. | Multitasking, process scheduling, thread management. |
| **Protection**          | Ensuring processes can only access their own memory.                       | User account management, user mode vs privileged mode. |
| **Resource Management** | Granting access to resources while maintaining mutually exclusive access.   | Synchronization mechanisms, deadlock handling. |
| **Scheduling**          | Determining the order of process execution.                                | Priority scheduling, round-robin scheduling. |
| **Security**            | Extending protection across the network.                                   | Encryption, access control. |
| **User Interface**      | Providing an interface for users to interact with the OS, applications, and hardware. | GUI, CLI, menu-driven interfaces. |
