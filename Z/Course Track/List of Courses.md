|Duration :|12 weeks|

Web Technology refers to the many different tools and techniques that are utilized in the process of communication between different types of devices over the internet in Hindi/English Language. The main sections or components of Web Technology are World Wide Web (WWW), Web Browser, Web Server, Web Pages, and Web Development. It can be classified into two ways: Frontend and Backend Development. The part of a website where the user interacts directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the client-side of the application. Backend is the server side of a website. It is the part of the website that users cannot see and interact with. It is the part of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It is used to arrange/store data. The frontend languages are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, etc. and Backend Languages are PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, C# etc.

## Linear Algebra Through Geometry   
(Will take on Later Time)
https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc24_cs111/preview
By Prof. M Krishna Kumar, Prof. Ashok Rao, Prof. Arulalan M R   |   IISc Bangalore, NITK Surathkal
|Duration :|12 weeks|
**PREREQUISITES:** Basic Mathematics at school and undergraduate level
**ABOUT THE COURSE:**  
This course will provide a holistic approach to LA covering both the algebraic and more importantly, geometric perspectives.  
A typical linear algebra course focuses on explaining the action of a matrix in abstract or algebraic language. However, we know that a picture is worth a thousand words. While algebra is useful for computation, it rarely provides sufficient intuition. This course provides  
(a) a more holistic approach to linear algebra, helping students comprehend concepts and connect them to their respective domains effectively.  
(b) intuition and visualizations, whenever and wherever possible, to concepts of linear algebra such as vector spaces, subspaces, eigenvectors and systems of linear equations.  
This approach will motivate learners to create their own illustrations and examples to fully understand the various ideas.

By Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar   |   IIT Ropar
Duration : 12 weeks

ABOUT THE COURSE :  

A fun filled whirlwind tour of 30 hrs, covering everything you need to know to fall in love with the most sought after skill of the 21st century. The course brings programming to your desk with anecdotes, analogies and illustrious examples. Turning abstractions to insights and engineering to art, the course focuses primarily to inspire the learner's mind to think logically and arrive at a solution programmatically. As part of the course, you will be learning how to practice and culture the art of programming with Python as a language. At the end of the course, we introduce some of the current advances in computing to motivate the enthusiastic learner to pursue further directions.

## Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms using Python
https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc24_cs78/preview
By Prof. Madhavan Mukund   |   Chennai Mathematical Institute
Duration : 8 Weeks

ABOUT THE COURSE :
This course is an introduction to programming and problem solving in Python.  It does not assume any prior knowledge of programming.  Using some motivating examples, the course quickly builds up basic concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, lists, strings and tuples.  It goes on to cover searching and sorting algorithms, dynamic programming and backtracking, as well as topics such as exception handling and using files.  As far as data structures are concerned, the course covers Python dictionaries as well as classes and objects for defining user defined datatypes such as linked lists and binary search trees.
