saw so many with colorful peels, 
shiny, fluffy, attractive, protective and sustaining peels,
very quickly realized that they are just peels,
thought, attractive or not, who likes a fruit for its peels,

fell one by one as with curious eyes i took apart the layers of peels,
expecting to find something that is within, which isn't a covering peel.

disappointed and disheartened to see nothing lying beyond the peels, 
the whole of it was just peels with no fruit, a shell of peels, so is it all about peels?

The struggle of trying to understand why maintain all these layers of peels which hold nothing,
all is just garbage and worthless if all who i am is just bundle of peels,

i didn't set my eyes on anyone who was not just in the peels, 
peel away the layers and person diminishes and is gone with it, a hollow shell of peels.

couldn't come to terms with this that life is just this, and all i know as me are peels,
something didn't seem right, even if all seem to say otherwise, sense said something else,

i kept peeling and peeling all that i saw out of habit, peeling off the peels 
and looking if anything else exists,
the day came when the same curious eyes started on peeling but
saw even with each layer removed it didn't diminish, the whole was still there,
the peels for transaction, peels of convenience, peels of tradition and decisions,
peels of views and opinions, peels of shape, body and gender, 
peels of ability and capabilities, all the peels that i knew, had seen i peeled,

but still what existed still existed even without all those peels,
all those layers of peels were just there to pass through the world,
but none had any value and they removed no value when they fell,
the whole existed beyond it and existed before all the peels were gathered,
all those peels gathered had not suffocated and reduced what was inside,

i saw it is possible and that's all the proof i needed, I'm not just gatherer of peels,
i don't have to loose value or gain value from peels, 
the grown fruit should gather peels when its required,
but need not get anymore sweetness from it, it cannot add or remove it,
the fruit of life though hidden, shouldn't be suffocating and taking more value than the fruit.
