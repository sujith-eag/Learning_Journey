- Rollups (Optimistic & ZK-Rollups)

📌 **Resources:**

- "Building Ethereum DApps" by Roberto Infante
- Solana Development Docs (If interested in Rust)

---

### **5️⃣ Web3 & dApp Development**

✅ **Frontend for Blockchain**

- Learn **React.js** or **Next.js**
- Integrate with Ethereum using **Ethers.js** or **Web3.js**

✅ **Backend for Blockchain**

- Use **Node.js** or **Python Flask/Django**
- Store data off-chain (IPFS, Arweave)

✅ **DeFi, NFTs & GameFi**

- Learn how **DEXs (Uniswap, PancakeSwap)** work
- Understand **NFT Standards (ERC-721, ERC-1155)**
- Explore **Play-to-Earn (Axie Infinity, Illuvium)**

📌 **Resources:**

- Build a full-stack Web3 app using BuildSpace
- Learn how Uniswap works by studying its smart contracts

---

### **6️⃣ Advanced Topics & Specialization**

✅ **Blockchain Security**

- Common attacks (Reentrancy, Front-running, 51% attacks)
- Smart contract auditing (MythX, Slither, CertiK)

✅ **Scaling & Performance**

- Sharding, Sidechains, and Rollups
- Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism

✅ **Enterprise Blockchain Development**

- Hyperledger Fabric (For private, permissioned blockchains)
- R3 Corda (For financial institutions)

📌 **Resources:**

- "Ethereum Smart Contract Security" by Richard Moore
- Blockchain Council Certifications (For Enterprise Blockchain)

---

### **7️⃣ Get Hands-On Experience & Build Portfolio**

✅ **Build Real Projects**

- Create a **Decentralized Voting System**
- Develop an **NFT Marketplace**
- Build a **DeFi Yield Farming dApp**

✅ **Contribute to Open Source**
