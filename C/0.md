```c
#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
	printf("Hello World!\n");
}
```

### Data Types

`int, float, char, char d[]`

___

#### Reading in variables Using `scanf`

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int a;
scanf("%d", &a);
printf("The number is: %d\n", a);
```
The `scanf` cannot be with any statement, has to be alone as the address of a variable is passed to it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void main ()
{
	float b;
	scanf("%f", &b);
	printf("The number is: %f\n", b);
	
	char c;
	scanf("%c", &c);
	printf("The character is: %c\n", c);
	
	char d[10];
	scanf("%s", &d);
	printf("The character array is: %d\n", d);
}
```
Each data type has its own assignment companion `d, f, c, s`

___

#### Sizeof Operator

`sizeof()` operator is used to evaluate the size of a variable.
It passes back a `long unassigned integer` which needs its own type of companion `%ld` to print the value. The size will be one more than the actual as it includes the ending character.

```c
#include <stdin.h>

void main()
{
	char x[] = "Length of string";
	printf("Size of char array is %ld\n", sizeof(x)); 
}
# will be 17
```

___

#### Constant variable

Making a value into a constant which cannot be altered or reassigned.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
	const int a = 5;
	a = 6;
	
	printf("the value of a == %d\n", a);
}
```


___

### Area of circle

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
	const float pi = 3.14;
	float radius;
	double area;
	
	printf("Enter the radius of the circlr: \n");
	scanf("%f", &radius);
	area = 2*pi*radius;

	printf("Area of circle with radius %.2f, is %.2lf\n", radius, area);
}
```

`double` is larger than float  ??
`%.2f` gives 2 decimal precision but what is `%.2lf` as just `%.2f` worked the same way ??


___

### Operators

`+ - * / %` and incremental operators `++  --`
`a = ++b;` 
`a = --b;`

reversing the placement of incremental signs in a loop or print will be post increment as opposed to pre increment.

`&` and,  `|` or,   `^` xor, `~`inverse??, `<<` left shift, `>>` right shift

`-=`, `+=`, `*=`, `/=`

___
___

## Type cast

Switching the variable types ??

```c
int a = 5;
float b;

b = a;
b = (float)a;
```

___

### Switch case

Get an input, pass it to switch, if a matches any case then it runs the specified code till next break.

```c
int a;
printf("Type any number from 1 to 5");
scanf("%d", a);

switch(a)
{
	case 1: printf("Addition\n");
			break;
	case 2: printf("substraction\n");
			break
	default: printf("Type properly\n");
}
```
