Rest and Sleep have rejuvenated the tired physical, but
	it's the intensity and aliveness in activity that fulfilled this life.

**Motions** and **Actions** sustain this life, but
	it's the ***Silence*** and ***Stillness*** that fulfilled this life.

Adventures of **Knowledge** and it's **Fruits** that sustain this life, but 
	it's the Arrival of ***Clarity*** and realizing the **Stupidity** that fulfilled this life.

**Personality** and **Abilities** sustain this life, but
	it's the ***Abandon*** and lessons of ***Disabilities*** that fulfilled this life.

Magic of **Rigid Logic** and **Functional tools** maintains this life, but
	it's the Ebb, swell and flow of ***Love*** and ***Emotion*** that fulfilled this life.

Finding **Oneself** and **Ways of the World** that sustained this life, but
	only by ***Loosing Oneself*** and all ***Known Ways*** is what fulfilled this life.

	its the ***Inclusion*** and all ***encompassing embrace of compassion*** that fulfilled this life.

Me, just a **simple thing** that sustains this life, but

A design so odd, contradictories exist in one as one!!
**Darkness of Black** within the **Light of White**,
**Movement of Sound** in silence,	**Stillness of Silence** in sound,
**Nothing** within the universe,    	**Universe** being within nothing,
**Freedom** born out of bondage,	**Bondage** a part of freedom,
**Individual** within the crowd,	        **Crowd** within the individual,
**Good and Sanity**  being within as parts of, **Bad and Insanity**.
Both forming the whole, one not existing without the other.

Is there a **threshold or boundary** beyond which one begins and another ends !!
Do parts and sides actually exist beyond the **bounds of mind** !!
Except within the tricky **realms of ideas**, where else does this and that exist !!
Life and it's Fulfillment, 	Separate!! or One within the other !!

There hasn't been two to be selected from, it's always been one whole.
Choosing one over the other, creating the divide of high and low, this and that,
both shall seize to be . . . **There is just one and that is the whole.** 
**Life and it's Fulfillment**, An inseparable part within each other, **a complete whole**.
