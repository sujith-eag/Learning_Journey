### Understanding rendering

this isn’t directly useful in practice, but it’s very important background information to understand what is going on in your application.

A functional component will render for one of three reasons:
* The component has just been mounted (as in, the component wasn’t in the component tree before, and it is now).
* The parent component re-rendered.
* The component uses stateful hooks, which have updated.

If none of the preceding things happen, your component won’t re-render, and that’s a guarantee.

#### Rendering on mount

Conditionally rendering a component, we can mount a component only if a flag is true, if false it is unmounted.

```jsx
return (
	<main>
		{hasDropdown && (<RemoteDropdown />) }
	</main>
);
```

or we always mount and simply toggle a flag as a property 
```jsx
return (
	<main>
		<RemoteDropDown isVisible={hasDropdown} />
	</main>
);
```

```jsx
function RemoteDropDown( {isVisible} )
{
	const [options, setOptions] = useState([]);
	
	useEffect( () => {
		// loading happens here
	}, [] );
	
	if(!isVisible) {
		return null;	
	}
	// Rest of component
}
```

While this approach to conditional rendering is generally not recommended (and the former approach is), this can be a handy tool when you don’t want your component to mount and unmount again and again, but you want to keep it in the document all the time while only sometimes actually rendering anything.

#### Rendering on parent render

every child component also renders when their parent component renders.

```jsx
function Icon() {
	return <img src="/arrow.pn" alt="" />;
}

function Button()
{
	const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(false);
	
	const style = { border: `1px solid ${enabled ? "red" : "black"}`; };

	return (
		<button style={style} onClick={() => setEnabled(b => !b)}>
			<Icon /> Toggle
		</button>
	);
}
```

Creating a Dice Roller

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Dice()
{
	const style = {
		border: "2px solid black",
		display: "inline-block",
		width: "2em",
		height: "2em",
		textAlign: "center",
		lineHeight: 2,	
	};
	const value = Math.floor(6 * Math.random());
	
	return <span style={style}>{value}</span>;
}

function DiceRoller()
{
	const [rolls, setRolls] = useState(1);
	
	return(
		<main>
			<h1>Rolls: {rolls}</h1>
			<button onClick={ () => setRolls( (r) => r+1 ) }>
				Re-Roll
			</button>
{/*When we click the button, we increase the roll count,
which forces a complete render of component,
causing all child to render and give new values*/}
		<div>
			<Dice />
			<Dice />
			<Dice />
		</div>
		</main>
	);
}
function App() {
	return <Diceroller />;
}
export default App;
```

On a general level, you should always put such variable content (e.g., the value of a dice roll) inside component state, and not depend on it just magically updating on every render as in the preceding example. This makes the previous example a terrible React design pattern.

> [!note]
> A much better structure is for the parent component to generate three random numbers and pass them to the dice as properties.

#### Rendering on State update

When you update the state inside a stateful hook, your component using that hook will render. That’s the whole purpose of updating the state.

But you can also render too often if your state contains data that updates often. You want to avoid components rendering all the time, as it can be very CPU and/or memory intensive for the browser, as well as annoying for the user.

A potential source of frequently updated information is something like the mouse position. A user can move the mouse around a lot. If you
have multiple components that store the mouse position in state, you’ll have multiple components rendering many times per second.

##### Storing Higher-level information

Instead of comparing to numbers all the time, the state is stored if it is on the left side or right side and nothing else. so it renders only when side changes.

```jsx
function BlinkingBackground() 
{
	const [isLeft, setLeft] = useState(true);
	const onMouseMove = (evt) =>
		setLeft(evt.nativeEvent.offsetX < 100);
	const style = {
		backgroundColor: isLeft ? "blue" : "red"
	};
	return <div style={style} onMouseMove={onMouseMove} />;
}
```

React only renders a component on a state update if the state actually changed value. We call the setter function often, but because we only store a Boolean value, which only changes from true to false as the cursor moves over the center of the component, most calls to the setter are simply ignored, as they don’t alter the component state.

now our component only renders when something happens that affects the output.


##### Manipulating DOM Element Directly

##### Rendering inside function

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Icon({ type }) 
{
	return <img src={`/images/${type}.png`} width="16" alt="" />;
}

function Button({ label, getIcon }) 
{
	const [pressed, setPressed] = useState(false);
	return(
		<button onClick={() => setPressed((p) => !p)}>
		{getIcon(pressed)}
		{label}
		</button>
{/*button click calls getIcon function inside the LockButton*/}
	);
}

function LockButton()
{
	const getIcon = (pressed) =>
		pressed ? <Icon type="lock" /> : <Icon type="unlock" />;
	return <Button label="Lock" getIcon={getIcon} />;	
}

function App()
{
	return <LockButton />;
}
export default App;
```

we render the icon component inside a function and not directly inside our component.

it can be a bit hard to optimize this bit of source code or even figure out exactly what’s going on. However, we can also achieve the same result in a much more familiar way.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Icon({ type }) 
{
	return <img src={`/images/${type}.png`} width="16" alt="" />;
}

function Button({ label, ButtonIcon }) 
{
	const [pressed, setPressed] = useState(false);
	return(
		<button onClick={() => setPressed((p) => !p)}>
		<ButtonIcon pressed={pressed} />
		{label}
		</button>
	);
}

function LockIcon( { pressed} )
{
	return pressed ? <Icon type="lock" /> : <Icon type="unlock" />;
}

function LockButton()
{
	return <Button label="Lock" ButtonIcon={LockIcon} />;
}
function App()
{
	return <LockButton />;
}
export default App;
```

### Life cycle of a class-based component

When a class-based component mounts, renders, and unmounts, rather than using hooks, you can use life cycle methods to react to the different stages in the component life cycle. The methods are named after what they do and where they fit into the life cycle, so they’re fairly self-evident most of the time.

You ought to be using functional components, but if you do come across a class-based component, and you want to refactor it to a functional one.


##### Life Cycle Methods

When a component mounts, these class methods are called (in this order):
* constructor()
* static getDerivedStateFromProps()
* render()
* componentDidMount()


When a class-based component updates, the following methods are invoked (in this order):
* static getDerivedStateFromProps()
* shouldComponentUpdate() 
* render()
* getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
* componentDidUpdate()

#### Converting life cycle methods to hooks

* constructor()—This method can be implemented either using a useEffect() with no dependencies or, if used for precalculating expensive values, in useMemo() with no dependencies.
* getDerivedStateFromProps()—This can be implemented with a useEffect() hook with the relevant properties as dependencies.
* render()—The entire functional component is the render function.
* componentDidMount()—This method is mostly used for exactly what a useEffect() hook with no dependencies achieves.
* componentDidUnmount(), which is then the equivalent cleanup function for the useEffect() hook.
* componentDidUpdate()—This can be emulated with a useEffect hook with dependencies set to the relevant values that have changed and caused whatever changed behavior that you want to react to.
* componentDidUnmount()—Functionality in this method can be moved to a cleanup function in a useEffect (or useLayoutEffect) hook with no dependencies. This is often used to cancel subscriptions or intervals set on mount, so it goes together with the effect in the same hook.


____

Summary
*  A React component has an individual life cycle for each instance of the component.
* The useEffect hook is the primary way to trigger side effects that are relevant for the particular component as a component mounts, renders, and unmounts.
* By carefully crafting the dependency array, you can trigger an effect hook to run at exactly the times you need it to run, which is how you can make smart components that interact with the browser, network, and user in many different ways.
* Components render whenever React determines that they need to under three main circumstances: when the component mounts, when the state of the component updates, and when the parent component renders.
* Class-based components can’t use hooks but rely on life cycle methods for similar behavior. These can be converted to hooks, but the conversion isn’t always straightforward.
