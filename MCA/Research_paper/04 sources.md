### **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Standards**

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been at the forefront of standardizing cryptographic algorithms resistant to quantum attacks. In August 2024, NIST finalized three Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for post-quantum cryptography:

1. **FIPS 203**: Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard
2. **FIPS 204**: Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard
3. **FIPS 205**: Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard

These standards are designed to protect sensitive information against potential threats posed by quantum computers. The algorithms selected include CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation and CRYSTALS-Dilithium for digital signatures, both of which are lattice-based and offer strong security foundations.

The transition to these post-quantum standards is a significant step toward ensuring long-term data security. Organizations are encouraged to begin integrating these algorithms into their systems to safeguard against future quantum-enabled threats. https://www.quantum.gov/nist-draft-report-on-pqc-transition/?utm_source=chatgpt.com

Integrating chaos-based encryption with AI-driven anomaly detection in real-time embedded systems (RTES) is an emerging field with both theoretical and practical advancements. Several studies have explored components of this integration, leading to prototype implementations that demonstrate feasibility.

**1. Chaotic Encryption in RTES:** Researchers have developed chaotic encryption schemes tailored for RTES. For instance, a study presented a chaotic stream cipher implemented on Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA, achieving a throughput of 1.5 Gbps. This design leverages logistic maps for pseudo-random number generation, ensuring security with minimal computational overhead, making it suitable for embedded devices.

**2. AI-Driven Anomaly Detection:** The application of AI for anomaly detection in encrypted traffic has been explored, focusing on datasets, feature extraction, and detection algorithms. A systematic literature review confirmed the use of various AI-based techniques for detecting anomalies over encrypted traffic, highlighting the potential of AI in enhancing security in encrypted communications.

**3. Combined Approaches:** A notable example of integrating chaotic systems with anomaly detection is the Real-Time Adaptive and Lightweight Anomaly Detection (RALAD) mechanism. This system employs a chaotic system for key synchronization and data integrity verification, efficiently detecting anomalies within virtual groups in real-time scenarios. The RALAD mechanism addresses key exposure issues and ensures secure communication in cyber-physical systems.

While these studies demonstrate the feasibility of combining chaos-based encryption with AI-driven anomaly detection in RTES, comprehensive systems fully integrating all these components are still under active research. The existing prototypes and theoretical models provide a strong foundation for future developments in this interdisciplinary domain.
