Chaos-based encryption is a promising approach to secure communication due to its complexity
and unpredictability. However, various challenges lie in the design and implementation of efficient,
low-power, attack-resistant chaos-based encryption schemes with high encryption and decryption rates.

Numerous algorithms are developed
for asymmetric encryption, such as Rivest-Shamir-Adleman
(RSA), the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), and Elliptic
Curve Cryptography (ECC).

The security of RSA and ECC
relies on the difficulty of integer factorization and discrete
logarithm problems.

approach to security. The CRYSTALS-Kyber

chaotic map [18] for secret-key exchange. This approach
has been shown to be effective in a hash algorithm for a
stream cipher that is designed for the PQC era. By leveraging
the chaotic behavior of the Lorenz map and other chaotic
equations, it is possible to create a secure and robust
encryption scheme that is resistant to attacks from quantum
computers.



Synchronization between the encryptor
and decryptor is a key component of a chaotic cryptosystem.
To solve this issue, Machine Learning (ML) approaches can
be used to synchronize the output signal.
