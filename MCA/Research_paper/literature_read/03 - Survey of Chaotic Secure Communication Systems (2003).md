Secure communication using synchronization between chaotic
systems(chaotic secure communication, for short) is a new concept of
secure communication. The great potentials of this kind of “hardware
key” secure communication systems had driven the progress of this
field rapidly



n this paper, a detailed history of chaotic secure
communication systems is given. The disadvantage of the first three
generations of chaotic secure communication schemes is low efficiency
of channel usage. To overcome this disadvantage, a chaotic communi-
cation scheme, which belongs to the fourth generation, using impul-
sive synchronization of chaotic systems is presented.

We conclude
that impulsive synchronization is more robust than continuous syn-
chronization.





Since only synchronization impulses are sent to the driven system in an
impulsive synchronization scheme, the information redundancy in the trans-
mitted signal is reduced. In this sense, even low-dimensional chaotic systems
can provide high security.



First gen - “chaotic mask”


The second generation was proposed during
1993 to 1995 known as chaotic modulation. This generation used two differ-
ent ways to modulate message signals into chaotic carriers. The first method
called chaotic parameter modulation[27] shown in Fig. 7(a) used message sig-
nals to change parameters of the chaotic transmitter. The second method
called chaotic non-autonomous modulation[28] shown in Fig. 7(b) used the
message signal to change the phase space of the chaotic transmitter.





The security of the whole system depends on the parameters and struc-
tures of the chaotic systems used in the receiver and the transmitter. For
military applications, the structures of chaotic systems can be changed by
plugging in different “hardware keys”(circuits) to achieve extremely high
security. For commercial applications, the structures of chaotic systems will
keep the same for each mobile station. However, different parameters of
chaotic systems can be assigned to different mobile stations to achieve a high
degree of security. Since the digitized synchronization impulses are sampled
at around 1Hz, even if an intruder can recover all digitized synchronization
impulses, the dynamics of the chaotic system can not be reconstructed by
using synchronization impulses without knowing the parameters. Thus the
key stream x(i) can not be reconstructed from synchronization impulses.
