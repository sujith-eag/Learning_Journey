### Research Problem Statement

- Current Gap : Lack of a unified framework integrating chaos-based encryption, machine learning (ML)-driven anomaly detection, and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for RTES and IoT security.

- **Existing Issues:**
    - Chaos-based encryption lacks real-time adaptability to evolving cyber threats.
    - ML-driven IDS systems are not integrated with encryption to dynamically adjust security parameters.
    - PQC methods like CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Falcon are promising but have not been evaluated for lightweight encryption in resource-constrained environments.

- **Research Need :** Develop a **cohesive security framework** that integrates these techniques to address evolving cyber threats in **RTES** and **IoT systems**.

2. **Enhance Security and Minimize Overhead** by analyzing limitations of existing encryption methods

3. **Evaluate Cryptographic Methods** exploring **chaos-based encryption techniques** (e.g., logistic maps, Lorenz attractors) for increased **unpredictability** and **security**.

4. **Real-Time Threat Adaptation** by Integrating ML-driven anomaly detection to dynamically adjust encryption parameters in response to evolving threats.

5. **Test Feasibility** by comparing the **security strength**, **computational efficiency**, and **adaptability** of the proposed framework against conventional methods.

### Research Hypotheses

- H1: A unified framework combining chaos-based encryption, ML anomaly detection, and PQC will provide greater security and real-time adaptability compared to traditional cryptographic methods.

- H2: The integration of true random number generation (TRNG) and chaos-based encryption will enhance the unpredictability and resilience of encryption in resource-constrained RTES/IoT environments.

- H3: Machine learning-based adaptive security will enable real-time responses to cyber threats, reducing the impact of attacks on RTES and IoT systems.
