### Research Methodology: Adaptive Security Framework for RTES & IoT


#### 1. Chaotic Key Generation & Encryption

- **Chaotic Systems:** Utilize chaotic maps (logistic map, Lorenz attractor, etc.) for **highly random and unpredictable key generation**.
- **True Random Number Generator (TRNG):** Entropy from physical sources (sensor noise, environmental changes) to generate random seeds.
- **Encryption Process:**
    - **Bitwise XOR operations** between plaintext and chaotic key stream.
    - Enhanced with **chaotic substitution & permutation** for stronger security.
    - **Low-power suitability** for embedded systems.

#### 2. AI-Driven Anomaly Detection & Adaptive Security

- **Lightweight ML Models**: Continuously monitor for threats with minimal resource usage.
    - Techniques: **Autoencoders**, **LSTM**, **One-Class SVM**, **Isolation Forests**.
- **Dynamic Threat Response:**
    - Upon anomaly detection, **adjust encryption parameters** (e.g., reinitialize keys, modify chaotic map parameters).
    - Use **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** for **self-optimization** of security settings over time.

#### 3. Post-Quantum Authentication

- **Quantum-Resistant Authentication:**
    - Use of **PQC** methods like **Kyber** and **NTRU** for **secure key exchange** and **identity verification**.
    - **Hash-based digital signatures** (e.g., **SPHINCS+**) for tamper-resistant verification.
- **Session-based One-Time Tokens**: Protects against replay attacks by eliminating static passwords and keys.

#### 4. Integration & Security Enhancement

- A cohesive framework combining chaotic encryption, AI-driven anomaly detection, and post-quantum authentication to provide adaptive, lightweight, and quantum-resistant security for RTES and IoT devices.
