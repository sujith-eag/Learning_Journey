### **Abstract**

The increasing adoption of real-time embedded systems (RTES) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to a surge in cyber threats, exposing critical vulnerabilities in conventional encryption and authentication mechanisms such as RSA, ECC, and AES, which have high computational overhead and are not quantum safe.

This paper proposes an adaptive, lightweight, and quantum-safe security framework integrating chaos-based encryption, true random number generators (TRNGs) ensuring unpredictability and high entropy, and a lightweight, machine learning-based intrusion detection system (IDS) to adapt the security mechanism dynamically to threats by modifying encryption parameters to mitigate risks in real time.

This research lays the foundation for future developments in post-quantum cryptography and chaos-based security solutions for resource-constrained real-time systems.
