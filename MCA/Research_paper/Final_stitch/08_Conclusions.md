The rapid proliferation of **real-time embedded systems (RTES) and IoT devices** has introduced **unprecedented cybersecurity challenges**, particularly in ensuring **lightweight, adaptive, and quantum-resistant encryption**. 

Traditional encryption methods, such as RSA and ECC, rely on **mathematical complexity** for security, but they face **significant computational overhead** and are **vulnerable to future quantum attacks**. Moreover, **static cryptographic approaches** struggle to provide real-time adaptability against **evolving cyber threats**.

To address these limitations, this paper proposed an **integrated security framework** that combines: Chaos-based encryption for lightweight, high-entropy, and quantum-safe cryptographic protection. AI-driven anomaly detection for real-time adaptation against network intrusions and cyber threats. Dynamic authentication mechanisms that ensure secure device interaction and prevent unauthorized access.
