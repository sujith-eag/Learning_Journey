The rapid growth of **embedded systems** and the **Internet of Things (IoT)** has revolutionized industries, enabling real-time automation, remote monitoring, and seamless connectivity across critical infrastructure, healthcare, industrial control systems (ICS), and consumer applications. With billions of IoT devices deployed globally, the embedded computing landscape is expanding at an unprecedented pace, offering efficiency, scalability, and data-driven intelligence.

However, this rapid proliferation has also **exposed significant security challenges**. Unlike traditional computing systems, **real-time embedded systems (RTES) and IoT devices** operate under **severe resource constraints**—low power, limited computational capacity, and minimal security provisions—making them prime targets for cyber-attacks. {link}

### Challenges in Securing RTES & IoT Devices

Traditional encryption methods like **RSA, ECC, and AES** are computationally expensive, making them **unsuitable for low-power embedded systems**. Additionally, these cryptographic techniques rely on **mathematical complexity** for security, but advances in **quantum computing** threaten to break these encryption schemes in the near future.

Authentication in RTES is another critical challenge. **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, replay attacks, and firmware tampering** are rising concerns, as IoT devices often lack robust identity verification mechanisms. Many security breaches occur due to **static encryption keys, predictable authentication patterns, or weak cryptographic implementations**.

### **Security Risks & Real-World Consequences**

Compromising an RTES or IoT device **can have devastating real-world consequences** which will increase in the future :

- **Healthcare Attacks:** Hacked **medical implants, insulin pumps, or pacemakers** can be **manipulated to harm patients**. {link}
- **Industrial & Smart Grid Threats:** Cybercriminals targeting **industrial control systems (ICS)** can **shut down power grids, disrupt factories, or sabotage oil pipelines**. {link}
- **Automotive Security Threats:** Connected vehicles rely on **embedded ECUs** for safety and navigation. {link}
- **Smart Home & Consumer IoT Breaches:** Weak authentication in smart locks, surveillance cameras, and voice assistants has led to **home invasions and privacy violations**. {link}

To address these threats, **a new security paradigm** is needed—one that is: **Lightweight** and suitable for RTES with limited resources. **Dynamic & Adaptive** to responds to real-time threats. **Unpredictable & Non-Deterministic** which is quantum-safe.

This paper proposes an **adaptive, chaos-based encryption and authentication framework**, integrating **true random number generation (TRNG), machine learning anomaly detection, and post-quantum cryptography (PQC)**. This approach aims to **enhance security while maintaining efficiency** for real-time embedded systems in mission-critical environments.
