## 4.1 Security Strength Against Classical & Quantum Attacks

### 4.1.1 Key Entropy & Unpredictability of Chaotic PRNGs

**Chaotic PRNGs** exhibit **high entropy, non-linearity, and sensitivity to initial conditions**, ensuring that: The generated keys are **unpredictable and unique** for each session. Even minimal variations in input **produce vastly different outputs**, making cryptanalysis infeasible. **No polynomial-time algorithms exist** to reverse-engineer the chaotic sequence. Traditional encryption relies on **mathematical complexity**, making it vulnerable to **predictive attacks** with advancements in computing. 

### **4.1.2 Resistance to Classical Attacks**

**Brute Force Attacks:** Unlike AES-256 or RSA-4096, where key search spaces are defined, chaotic keys evolve dynamically, making exhaustive search impractical.

**Side-Channel Attacks:** Low computational footprint reduces the system’s **power and timing signature**, minimizing vulnerability to side-channel attacks.

**Statistical & Cryptanalysis Attacks:** Key generation does not follow a **fixed, deterministic pattern**, preventing frequency-based attacks.

### **4.1.3 Resistance to Quantum Attacks**

- The proposed method does not rely on factorization or discrete logarithms, rendering Shor’s algorithm ineffective.
- Grover’s algorithm speeds up key searches, but chaotic keys are **not stored statically** and evolve dynamically. Have a **randomized key schedule**, mitigating quadratic search efficiency.
- Using **post-quantum cryptographic schemes** (e.g., lattice-based, hash-based) for authentication **eliminates dependence on RSA/ECC**, ensuring security even in a quantum era.

One of the critical concerns in RTES security is **computational overhead**. The proposed system ensures minimal impact on processing power, memory, and energy consumption than RSA/ECC, making it viable for low-power IoT/RTES.
**No large matrix operations** or modular exponentiations, reducing CPU overhead.
**Adaptive encryption strength**, allowing dynamic trade-offs between security and performance.
**Efficient key exchange** using **chaotic synchronization**, eliminating heavy cryptographic computations.

### **4.3 Case Studies & Simulations for Adaptability against Cyber Threats**

The integration of **AI-driven anomaly detection** enhances the system’s adaptability to evolving cyber threats.

**Scenario 1: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack Prevention :** 
**Anomaly detection** identifies unusual packet timing and handshake irregularities. **Adaptive encryption** switches to a more complex chaotic function for added security.

**Scenario 2: Replay Attack Defense :**
Chaotic key generation ensures that each session key is unique preventing the reuse of old keys.

**Scenario 3: AI-Based Intrusion Detection**
The system monitors **network flow deviations** using an **autoencoder-based anomaly detector**. If an attack pattern emerges, **the model retrains dynamically**, improving future threat detection.

If an **advanced attack** is detected, the system can: **Regenerate chaotic seeds** to alter encryption keys. **Adjust authentication mechanisms** (e.g., requiring multi-factor authentication). **Modify system behavior** in real-time to counteract new threats.
