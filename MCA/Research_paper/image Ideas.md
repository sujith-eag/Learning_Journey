A diagram showing the rise of IoT and RTES security threats. This could include a flowchart depicting how embedded systems interact with cloud servers, IoT networks, and external threats such as cyberattacks.


A bar chart comparing the rise of different types of cyber threats (DDoS, ransomware, MITM, phishing) over the years.


A high-level system architecture diagram of the proposed security framework. This should illustrate the interaction between the main components:

1. Chaos-based encryption module
2. AI-driven anomaly detection module
3. Post-quantum authentication module

Each module should be connected, showing how they communicate and respond dynamically to security threats.

A flowchart showing the steps in chaos-based encryption, including TRNG seed generation, CPRNG key expansion, and encryption process.


A flowchart illustrating the chaotic key generation process, showing how a **True Random Number Generator (TRNG)** generates a seed, which initializes a **Chaos-Based Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CPRNG)**, ultimately producing encryption keys. The image should also depict the encryption process where chaotic keys are used for bitwise XOR encryption.



A decision tree or flowchart showing how the AI model detects anomalies, adapts encryption parameters, and strengthens security based on detected threats. The image should display the input sources (network traffic, system logs, power consumption) feeding into lightweight ML models (Autoencoders, LSTM, Isolation Forest), which then trigger real-time security adjustments.



A comparative diagram showing the difference between traditional authentication methods (RSA, ECC) and post-quantum cryptographic techniques (lattice-based and hash-based authentication). The image should emphasize the security improvements in a quantum computing context.

A bar graph comparing the computational efficiency, power consumption, and encryption speed of different encryption algorithms (RSA, ECC, AES vs. Chaos-based).
