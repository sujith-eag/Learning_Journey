Future Challenges of the Internet of Things in the Health Care Domain - An Overview


**Abstract**

Medical IoT systems have recently become one of the most sophisticated medical technologies in well-developed countries. The remote monitoring of medical services may benefit greatly from this technology. According to a new study, security measures and training are critical in protecting IoMT systems from cyber-attacks. In this paper, the primary security and privacy challenges with IoMT are examined using current security solutions. Non-cryptographic and cryptographic approaches are used for a variety of attacks. It's therefore possible to compare the computational complexity of the various solutions and the resources they demand. Besides, the discussion of attack versions with causes for possible solutions, the dangerous scenarios of various attacks are also provided here. IoMT security methods, particularly in the rapidly expanding field of digital healthcare, show a trade-off between security level and system performance. There is a final section that talks about the acceptable security solutions, such as various attacks through common solution methods and protocols.




# A chaotic encryption scheme for real-time embedded systems: design and implementation

- Published: 02 June 2011

## Abstract

Chaotic encryption schemes are believed to provide greater level of security than conventional ciphers. In this paper, a chaotic stream cipher is first constructed and then its hardware implementation details over Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA are provided. Logistic map is the simplest chaotic system and has high potential to be used to design a stream cipher for real-time embedded systems. Its simple construct and non-linear dynamics makes it a common choice for such applications. In this paper, we present a Modified Logistic Map (MLM) which improves the performance of Logistic Map in terms of higher Lyapunov exponent and uniformity of bifurcation map. It also avoids the stable orbits of logistic map giving a more chaotic behavior to the system. A stream cipher is built using MLM and random feedback scheme. The proposed cipher gives 16 bits of encrypted data per clock cycle. The hardware implementation results over Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA give a synthesis clock frequency of 93 MHz and a throughput of 1.5 Gbps while using 16 hardware multipliers. This makes the cipher suitable for embedded devices which have tight constraints on power consumption, hardware resources and real-time parameters.







# Transitioning organizations to post-quantum cryptography

## Abstract

Quantum computers are expected to break modern public key cryptography owing to Shor’s algorithm. As a result, these cryptosystems need to be replaced by quantum-resistant algorithms, also known as post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms. The PQC research field has flourished over the past two decades, leading to the creation of a large variety of algorithms that are expected to be resistant to quantum attacks. These PQC algorithms are being selected and standardized by several standardization bodies. However, even with the guidance from these important efforts, the danger is not gone: there are billions of old and new devices that need to transition to the PQC suite of algorithms, leading to a multidecade transition process that has to account for aspects such as security, algorithm performance, ease of secure implementation, compliance and more. Here we present an organizational perspective of the PQC transition. We discuss transition timelines, leading strategies to protect systems against quantum attacks, and approaches for combining pre-quantum cryptography with PQC to minimize transition risks. We suggest standards to start experimenting with now and provide a series of other recommendations to allow organizations to achieve a smooth and timely PQC transition
