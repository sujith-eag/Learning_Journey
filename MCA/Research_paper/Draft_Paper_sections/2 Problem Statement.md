# **Problem Statement**

Real-time embedded systems (RTES) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices play a critical role in modern infrastructure, from **industrial control systems (ICS) and medical devices** to **autonomous vehicles and smart grids**. Despite their growing adoption, these systems are **highly vulnerable to cyberattacks** due to inherent **security limitations** such as **low computational power, lack of built-in cryptographic capabilities, and static encryption methods**. As a result, attackers increasingly target RTES and IoT devices, leading to **severe real-world consequences, including system failures, financial loss, and threats to human safety**.

### **Limitations of Current Encryption & Authentication Mechanisms**

1. **Computational Overhead in Traditional Encryption:**
    
    - Conventional cryptographic techniques like **RSA, ECC, and AES** rely on **complex mathematical computations** (e.g., large integer factorization, elliptic curve point multiplication).
    - These operations **consume significant processing power**, making them impractical for **low-power embedded systems**.
    - Real-time devices often **lack dedicated cryptographic hardware**, leading to performance bottlenecks and increased latency.
2. **Predictability & Determinism in Key Generation:**
    
    - **RSA and ECC derive security from deterministic mathematical problems**â€”while computationally hard today, they will become **breakable with advances in quantum computing**.
    - The **predictable structure of key generation** introduces vulnerabilities to attacks such as **side-channel attacks and AI-powered cryptanalysis**.
3. **Authentication Challenges in RTES & IoT**
    
    - Many embedded systems **lack proper identity verification**, making them vulnerable to **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, replay attacks, and unauthorized access**.
    - Static credentials (e.g., **hardcoded passwords, fixed encryption keys**) make it easier for attackers to **exploit firmware vulnerabilities and gain persistent access**.
4. **Lack of Adaptive Security Mechanisms**
    
    - **Current security solutions do not dynamically adjust encryption or authentication based on real-time threats.**
    - If a device is under attack, existing encryption methods remain static, making them ineffective against **evolving cyber threats like zero-day exploits**.

### **The Need for a Novel, Adaptive Security Solution**

To address these challenges, **a lightweight, adaptive encryption and authentication framework is required**, one that:

âœ… **Minimizes computational overhead**â€”ensuring encryption is efficient for resource-constrained RTES.  
âœ… **Remains unpredictable**â€”leveraging **chaos-based cryptography** to eliminate deterministic key generation.  
âœ… **Is quantum-resistant**â€”integrating elements of **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)** for future-proof security.  
âœ… **Dynamically adapts to security threats**â€”using **machine learning (ML) anomaly detection** to adjust encryption parameters in real-time.

This paper proposes a **chaos-enhanced encryption and authentication framework** that integrates **chaotic pseudo-random number generators (CPRNGs), true random number generation (TRNG), and ML-driven security monitoring**. The proposed system aims to offer a **lightweight, real-time security mechanism** that enhances protection against both **classical and quantum cyber threats** while ensuring **efficient operation in RTES and IoT environments**.
