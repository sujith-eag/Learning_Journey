# **Background & Motivation**

The rapid growth of **embedded systems** and the **Internet of Things (IoT)** has revolutionized industries, enabling real-time automation, remote monitoring, and seamless connectivity across critical infrastructure, healthcare, industrial control systems (ICS), and consumer applications. With billions of IoT devices deployed globally, the **embedded computing landscape** is expanding at an unprecedented pace, offering efficiency, scalability, and data-driven intelligence.

However, this rapid proliferation has also **exposed significant security challenges**. Unlike traditional computing systems, **real-time embedded systems (RTES) and IoT devices** operate under **severe resource constraints**—low power, limited computational capacity, and minimal security provisions—making them prime targets for cyberattacks. Research indicates that **over 1.5 billion IoT breaches** occurred in the first half of 2023 alone, with attacks ranging from **ransomware infections** and **supply chain compromises** to **botnet takeovers** and **nation-state cyber warfare** [[1]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).

### **Security Risks & Real-World Consequences**

Compromising an RTES or IoT device **can have devastating real-world consequences**:

- **Healthcare Attacks:** Hacked **medical implants, insulin pumps, or pacemakers** can be **manipulated to harm patients**. In 2022, vulnerabilities in **hospital infusion pumps** exposed over **200 million medical devices** to potential attacks [[2]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).
- **Industrial & Smart Grid Threats:** Cybercriminals targeting **industrial control systems (ICS)** can **shut down power grids, disrupt factories, or sabotage oil pipelines**. The 2021 **Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack** halted fuel supply across the U.S. East Coast, causing widespread disruptions and financial loss [[3]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).
- **Automotive Security Threats:** Connected vehicles rely on **embedded ECUs** for safety and navigation. A **Tesla Model S** was remotely hacked in 2020, allowing attackers to take control of braking systems [[4]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).
- **Smart Home & Consumer IoT Breaches:** Weak authentication in smart locks, surveillance cameras, and voice assistants has led to **home invasions and privacy violations**. In 2021, attackers hijacked thousands of **Ring smart cameras**, spying on users and even interacting with children [[5]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).

### **Challenges in Securing RTES & IoT Devices**

Traditional encryption methods like **RSA, ECC, and AES** are computationally expensive, making them **unsuitable for low-power embedded systems**. Additionally, these cryptographic techniques rely on **mathematical complexity** for security, but advances in **quantum computing** threaten to break these encryption schemes in the near future.

Authentication in RTES is another critical challenge. **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, replay attacks, and firmware tampering** are rising concerns, as IoT devices often lack robust identity verification mechanisms. Many security breaches occur due to **static encryption keys, predictable authentication patterns, or weak cryptographic implementations**.

To address these threats, **a new security paradigm** is needed—one that is:

✅ **Lightweight** (suitable for RTES with limited resources).  
✅ **Dynamic & Adaptive** (responds to real-time threats).  
✅ **Unpredictable & Non-Deterministic** (chaos-based encryption).  
✅ **Resistant to Future Attacks** (quantum-safe cryptography).

This paper proposes an **adaptive, chaos-based encryption and authentication framework**, integrating **true random number generation (TRNG), machine learning anomaly detection, and post-quantum cryptography (PQC)**. This approach aims to **enhance security while maintaining efficiency** for real-time embedded systems in mission-critical environments.
