Hereâ€™s a **structured draft for the Proposed Methodology section**, ensuring that all componentsâ€”encryption, authentication, anomaly detection, and adaptive securityâ€”are **logically integrated** and well-explained.

# **Proposed Methodology**

## **1. Overview**

The proposed framework aims to **enhance the security of real-time embedded systems (RTES) and IoT devices** by integrating:

- **Chaos-based encryption** for lightweight, non-deterministic security.
- **Machine learning-driven anomaly detection** to monitor network behavior and dynamically adapt security parameters.
- **Quantum-resistant authentication** to ensure secure communication and prevent unauthorized access.

This methodology provides a **low-computation, adaptive, and future-proof** security model that addresses the limitations of **traditional cryptographic approaches** in resource-constrained environments.

---

## **2. System Components and Architecture**

The system is structured into three main components:

### **2.1 Chaotic Key Generation and Encryption**

The encryption process is based on **chaotic systems**, which exhibit **high sensitivity to initial conditions** and generate unpredictable key sequences. The steps involved are:

#### **2.1.1 True Random Number Generation (TRNG) for Initial Seed**

- A **True Random Number Generator (TRNG)** collects entropy from real-world physical sources (e.g., sensor noise, electronic fluctuations, environmental changes).
- This seed serves as the **starting input** for the chaotic system to generate encryption keys.

#### **2.1.2 Chaos-Based Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CPRNG)**

- Using a **chaotic map (e.g., Logistic Map, Lorenz Attractor, Chuaâ€™s Circuit)**, a **chaotic key stream** is generated.
- The key stream is **non-repeating and unpredictable**, making it resistant to attacks.

#### **2.1.3 Lightweight Encryption Process**

- The plaintext data is encrypted using:
    - **Bitwise XOR operations** with the chaotic key stream.
    - **Chaotic substitution and permutation techniques** to ensure diffusion and confusion.
- Since chaotic maps are **computationally inexpensive**, this method is well-suited for RTES with limited processing power.

---

### **2.2 Quantum-Resistant Authentication and Key Exchange**

To ensure **secure access control** and **tamper-proof key exchange**, the system integrates **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)** techniques.

#### **2.2.1 Authentication via Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**

- The system uses **lattice-based cryptographic methods** (e.g., Kyber, NTRU) to verify device identities.
- **Hash-based digital signatures (SPHINCS+)** ensure **tamper-proof authentication** without relying on conventional RSA/ECC keys.

#### **2.2.2 Secure Key Exchange Using Chaotic Sequences**

- The encryption keys are derived from **chaotic sequences**, making them **unique for each session** and resistant to replay attacks.
- A **shared chaotic parameter** is securely exchanged using **PQC-based key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs)**.

#### **2.2.3 Session-Based One-Time Authentication Tokens**

- Authentication tokens are dynamically generated from chaotic functions and **never reused**.
- These tokens **expire after each session**, preventing unauthorized re-use in future communications.

### **2.3 AI-Driven Anomaly Detection and Adaptive Security**

To provide **real-time intrusion detection and adaptive security**, a **lightweight AI model** is integrated, ensuring minimal computational overhead for RTES.

#### **2.3.1 Lightweight Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection**

A **compact, pre-trained anomaly detection model** continuously monitors system activity while ensuring minimal computational overhead for RTES. 

Suitable **lightweight models** that can be used are:
- **Autoencoders (AE)** â€“ Small neural networks that reconstruct normal data patterns and flag deviations as anomalies.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-Based Models** â€“ Efficient recurrent models that track temporal patterns in system logs to detect stealthy attacks.
- **One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-Class SVM)** â€“ A non-deep learning method that learns normal system behavior and flags anything outside it.
- **Isolation Forest (iForest)** â€“ A tree-based model that efficiently isolates outliers in real-time.

These models are optimized for low-power devices through **pruning, quantization, and model distillation** to ensure **fast, memory-efficient intrusion detection**. They analyze:  
- **Network traffic behavior** for deviations from expected patterns.
- **System operation logs** to detect unusual activity or privilege escalation.
- **Power and computation usage** for potential side-channel attack indicators.

When an anomaly is detected, **automated security responses** are triggered in real time, ensuring adaptive security with minimal latency.

---

#### **2.3.2 Adaptive Encryption Parameter Adjustment**

- If an anomaly is detected, the system **dynamically modifies encryption parameters** to mitigate threats:
    - **Reinitializing chaotic key generation** with a new TRNG seed for unpredictability.
    - **Altering chaotic map parameters** (e.g., logistic map, Lorenz attractor) to generate a new key stream.
    - **Increasing encryption complexity** proportionally to attack severity.
    - **Switching authentication methods** if suspicious activity is detected in identity validation.

#### **2.3.3 Reinforcement Learning for Self-Optimizing Security**

- A **lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) model** (e.g., **Deep Q-Network (DQN) with reduced parameter size**) fine-tunes security settings over time.
- The model **analyzes past attack patterns** and dynamically optimizes encryption and authentication configurations.
- **Minimizes computational overhead** by selecting the **most efficient security response** for detected threats.
