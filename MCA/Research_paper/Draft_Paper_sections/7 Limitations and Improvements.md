## **5.1 Limitations of the Proposed Approach**

While the proposed system offers **strong encryption, adaptive security, and computational efficiency**, it faces the following limitations:

### **5.1.1 Implementation Challenges**

- **Hardware Constraints:**
    - Many **RTES and IoT devices** operate on **low-power microcontrollers** with **limited computational resources**.
    - Implementing **chaotic key generation and AI-driven anomaly detection** may require **dedicated cryptographic accelerators** or **hardware optimization**.
- **Algorithm Complexity & Optimization:**
    - While chaos-based encryption is computationally **lightweight**, ensuring real-time performance requires **fine-tuning** of chaotic functions.
    - Certain chaotic maps (e.g., **Lorenz attractor**) require **floating-point precision**, which may not be available on all RTES architectures.

### **5.1.2 Key Synchronization Issues**

- **Challenge in Securely Synchronizing Chaotic PRNGs:**
    - Unlike traditional encryption, where keys are statically defined, chaotic systems require **both sender and receiver to remain synchronized** with the same initial conditions.
    - **Network delays, packet loss, or external interference** may cause desynchronization, leading to decryption failures.
    - **Solution:** Exploring **error-correction mechanisms** and using **self-recovering chaotic synchronization techniques** to mitigate this issue.

### **5.1.3 Vulnerability to Certain Attacks**

- **Side-Channel Attacks on IoT Devices:**
    - Although chaotic encryption minimizes **computational signatures**, **power analysis attacks** could still infer encryption patterns from **hardware leakage**.
    - **Mitigation:** Integrating **dynamic noise injection** or **shielded computation architectures**.
- **AI-Based Adversarial Attacks on Anomaly Detection:**
    - Attackers could use **adversarial ML techniques** to **manipulate the anomaly detection model**, reducing its ability to detect cyber threats.
    - **Future Research Needed:** Developing **robust, adversarial-resistant AI models** for anomaly detection.

## **5.2 Potential Improvements**

To address the above limitations, the following improvements can enhance the security, efficiency, and scalability of the system:

### **5.2.1 Combining Chaos-Based Encryption with Zero-Trust Architectures**

- Traditional **perimeter-based security models** assume that entities inside a network are **trustworthy**, which is no longer sufficient.

    - **Throughput & power efficiency** in IoT devices.
    - **Resistance to physical tampering & side-channel attacks**.
- Potential Future Work:
    - Designing **custom cryptographic co-processors** for chaotic encryption.
    - Implementing **low-power FPGA-based chaos PRNGs** for real-time authentication.

### **5.2.3 Enhancing AI-Driven Threat Adaptability**

- The anomaly detection component currently **monitors traffic and adapts encryption parameters**, but **further improvements** can be made:
    - **Federated Learning for Decentralized Threat Intelligence:**
        - Instead of relying on a centralized AI model, **RTES and IoT devices can collaboratively learn from distributed cyber threat patterns**, improving detection accuracy.
    - **Reinforcement Learning for Self-Healing Security:**
        - The AI model can **actively test and adjust security configurations**, responding in real-time to new threats.
    - **Explainable AI (XAI) for Transparency:**

### **5.2.4 Quantum-Resistant Authentication Schemes**

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) for Secure Authentication**
    - The proposed system ensures **quantum-resistant encryption**, but **authentication mechanisms** (e.g., digital signatures) must also be quantum-secure.
    - Future research could explore:
        - **Lattice-based signatures** for RTES authentication.
        - **Quantum-secure identity management** for IoT networks.
