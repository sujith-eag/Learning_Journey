# **Literature Review**

The security challenges faced by **real-time embedded systems (RTES) and IoT devices** have led to extensive research into **lightweight cryptography, chaos-based encryption, anomaly detection, and post-quantum cryptography**. This section reviews the existing literature on these topics and identifies gaps that this research aims to address.

## **1. Security Challenges in RTES and IoT Devices**

Real-time embedded systems and IoT devices are increasingly deployed in **critical sectors** such as healthcare, industrial automation, and smart infrastructure. However, their **low computational power, always-on connectivity, and limited security provisions** make them **highly vulnerable to cyberattacks**.

Research has shown that:

- IoT-based attacks have increased **by 400% since 2019**, with major threats including **DDoS attacks, firmware manipulation, and unauthorized access** [[1]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).
- Traditional security models rely on **predefined encryption schemes** that do not adapt dynamically to real-time threats, making them vulnerable to **zero-day exploits** [[2]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).
- Authentication in RTES is often **static and predictable**, allowing attackers to bypass weak identity verification mechanisms using **replay attacks and MITM attacks** [[3]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).

### **Gap Identified:** A need for an **adaptive and lightweight** encryption and authentication framework capable of securing RTES without excessive computational overhead.

## **2. Limitations of Traditional Cryptographic Techniques**

Existing encryption methods, such as **RSA, ECC, and AES**, rely on **deterministic mathematical problems**, such as prime factorization and elliptic curve calculations, for security. While these methods are robust today, research warns that:

- **Quantum computers** will eventually break RSA and ECC encryption using **Shorâ€™s algorithm**, making them obsolete [[4]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).
- **Computational complexity** in asymmetric encryption leads to **high power consumption**, making it unsuitable for resource-constrained RTES [[5]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).
- Traditional cryptography lacks **dynamic adaptation**, meaning it does not adjust to **real-time security threats**.

### **Gap Identified:** The need for a **non-deterministic, quantum-resistant** encryption method that is both **lightweight and adaptive**.

## **3. Chaos-Based Cryptography for Unpredictability**

Chaotic systems, such as **logistic maps, Lorenz attractors, and Chuaâ€™s circuits**, exhibit **high sensitivity to initial conditions**, making them excellent candidates for **pseudo-random number generation (PRNG)** in cryptographic applications. Research has demonstrated that:

- **Chaos-based encryption algorithms** can generate **high-entropy keys** that are computationally infeasible to predict [[6]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).
- Chaotic systems offer **lower computational cost** compared to RSA and ECC while maintaining high security [[7]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).
- The **3D chaotic attractor models** have been successfully used for **image encryption and secure communications**, proving their feasibility in embedded applications [[8]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).

### **Gap Identified:** Although chaos-based cryptography improves **unpredictability**, it **lacks real-time adaptability** in response to security threats.

## **4. Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection for Security**

AI and ML techniques have been widely studied for **intrusion detection** and **network anomaly detection**, showing significant improvements in identifying cyber threats in real-time. Research highlights that:

- **Deep learning models** (CNNs, RNNs) can accurately detect **malicious traffic** in IoT networks [[9]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).
- **Unsupervised learning techniques**, such as autoencoders and clustering algorithms, can identify **previously unknown attack patterns** [[10]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).
- Integrating **ML with cryptographic security mechanisms** has been proposed to dynamically **adjust encryption parameters based on detected anomalies** [[11]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).

### **Gap Identified:** Existing ML-based security solutions focus **only on anomaly detection** without **direct integration with encryption mechanisms** to strengthen security dynamically.

## **5. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Future-Proof Security**

To address the **threat of quantum computing**, researchers have proposed **post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms**, such as:

- **Lattice-based encryption (NTRU, Kyber)** â€“ Resistant to Shorâ€™s algorithm and suitable for constrained devices [[12]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).
- **Hash-based signatures (SPHINCS+)** â€“ Provide quantum-resistant authentication with lightweight implementations [[13]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).
- **Code-based cryptography (McEliece algorithm)** â€“ Offers long-term security but requires large key sizes [[14]](https://chatgpt.com/c/67bb12f9-28e8-8007-b7f0-86e6e004d509#).

### **Gap Identified:** PQC methods are computationally expensive, requiring further **optimization for RTES and IoT integration**.

## **6. Integrating Chaos-Based Cryptography with AI for RTES Security**

While research has explored **chaos-based encryption, ML-based anomaly detection, and PQC separately**, there is **no unified approach** that:

1. Uses **chaos-based cryptographic techniques** for lightweight and non-deterministic encryption.
2. Incorporates **machine learning-driven anomaly detection** to dynamically adjust encryption parameters based on real-time threats.
3. Ensures **quantum resistance** through integration with **post-quantum cryptographic methods**.

This research aims to fill this gap by developing a **novel, adaptive security framework** that combines:

- **Chaos-enhanced encryption** for low-cost unpredictability.
- **ML-powered intrusion detection** to dynamically adapt security mechanisms.
- **Quantum-resistant authentication** for future-proofing against advanced attacks.

### **Conclusion**

The literature demonstrates the **security limitations of RTES and IoT** and highlights promising approaches in **chaos-based cryptography, ML-driven anomaly detection, and PQC**. However, no existing framework fully integrates these elements into a **unified, lightweight, adaptive security system** for RTES. This research proposes to bridge this gap by developing a **dynamic, chaos-enhanced encryption and authentication model**, ensuring **efficient, real-time security against evolving cyber threats**.
