# **6. Conclusion**

The rapid proliferation of **real-time embedded systems (RTES) and IoT devices** has introduced **unprecedented cybersecurity challenges**, particularly in ensuring **lightweight, adaptive, and quantum-resistant encryption**. Traditional encryption methods, such as RSA and ECC, rely on **mathematical complexity** for security, but they face **significant computational overhead** and are **vulnerable to future quantum attacks**. Moreover, **static cryptographic approaches** struggle to provide real-time adaptability against **evolving cyber threats**.

To address these limitations, this paper proposed an **integrated security framework** that combines:  
âœ… **Chaos-based encryption** for lightweight, high-entropy, and quantum-safe cryptographic protection.  
âœ… **AI-driven anomaly detection** for real-time adaptation against network intrusions and cyber threats.  
âœ… **Dynamic authentication mechanisms** that ensure secure device interaction and prevent unauthorized access.

The proposed approach leverages **True Random Number Generators (TRNGs)** as a seed for **chaotic Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs)**, such as **logistic maps and Lorenz attractors**, to generate highly unpredictable encryption keys. The **AI-powered anomaly detection module** continuously monitors network activity, detecting **intrusions and attack patterns**, and dynamically adjusting **encryption parameters** to strengthen system security.
