### **Abstract**

The increasing adoption of real-time embedded systems (RTES) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to a surge in cyber threats, exposing critical vulnerabilities in conventional encryption and authentication mechanisms. Traditional cryptographic methods such as RSA, ECC, and AES, while effective, suffer from high computational overhead and rely on deterministic mathematical structures, making them susceptible to pattern recognition, brute force attacks and future quantum attacks. 

This paper proposes an adaptive, lightweight, and quantum-safe security framework integrating chaos-based encryption, true random number generators (TRNGs), and AI-driven anomaly detection to enhance the security of RTES.
The proposed approach leverages chaotic maps (e.g., logistic maps, Lorenz attractors) to generate dynamic encryption keys seeded by TRNGs, ensuring unpredictability and high entropy. A novel chaotic authentication mechanism, enabling secure communication without the computational overhead of traditional asymmetric key exchange protocols.

Furthermore, a lightweight, machine learning-based intrusion detection system (IDS) to continuously monitors network traffic, system logs, and power consumption patterns to detect anomalies and  adapt the security mechanism dynamically by modifying encryption parameters, re-initializing chaotic key generation or adjusting authentication measures to mitigate risks in real time. Additionally, reinforcement learning is incorporated to optimize security responses based on past attack patterns, ensuring continuous adaptation with minimal computational overhead.

Security analysis evaluates the proposed framework against classical and quantum attacks, highlighting its resilience against brute force, side-channel, and machine learning-based adversarial attacks. 
Performance benchmarks demonstrate computational efficiency, real-time adaptability, and feasibility for resource-constrained RTES. 

Despite its advantages, challenges such as synchronization issues, hardware compatibility, and further optimization for low-power environments remain. Future research directions include integrating zero-trust architectures, hardware-optimized chaotic encryption, and enhancing AI-driven security automation.

This research lays the foundation for future developments in post-quantum cryptography and chaos-based security solutions for resource-constrained real-time systems.
