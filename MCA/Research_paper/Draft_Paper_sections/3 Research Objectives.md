# **Research Objectives**

The primary objective of this research is to **develop a lightweight, adaptive encryption and authentication framework** for **real-time embedded systems (RTES) and IoT devices** that enhances security while minimizing computational overhead. This research aims to address the limitations of traditional cryptographic methods by integrating **chaos-based cryptography, machine learning-driven anomaly detection, and quantum-resistant techniques**.

### **Specific Objectives**

1. **To analyze the limitations of existing encryption and authentication mechanisms** in RTES and IoT, focusing on their computational overhead, predictability, and susceptibility to attacks.
    
2. **To explore and evaluate chaos-based encryption techniques**, such as **logistic maps, Lorenz attractors, and chaotic pseudo-random number generators (CPRNGs)**, in enhancing encryption unpredictability and security.
    
3. **To integrate a machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection model** that monitors real-time network activity, detects potential cyber threats, and dynamically adjusts encryption parameters to strengthen security.
    
4. **To design a lightweight, adaptive security framework** that incorporates:
    
    - **True random number generation (TRNG)** for non-deterministic key generation.
    - **Chaos-based cryptographic techniques** for lightweight encryption.
    - **ML-driven security adaptation** to dynamically respond to threats.
5. **To evaluate the proposed frameworkâ€™s feasibility and effectiveness** by comparing its performance (security strength, computational efficiency, adaptability) with traditional encryption methods in embedded environments.
    

By achieving these objectives, this research aims to contribute **a novel, quantum-resistant, real-time security mechanism** for embedded and IoT devices that is both **efficient and robust** against evolving cyber threats.
