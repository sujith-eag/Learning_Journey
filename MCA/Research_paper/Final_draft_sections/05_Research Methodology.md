## Proposed Methodology

The proposed **adaptive encryption and authentication framework** is designed to secure **real-time embedded systems (RTES) and IoT devices** by integrating **chaos-based cryptography, machine learning-based anomaly detection, and post-quantum authentication**. 

The system architecture consists of three primary components:
1. **Chaotic Key Generation and Encryption Mechanism** – Ensuring lightweight and unpredictable encryption.
2. **AI-Driven Anomaly Detection and Adaptive Security** – Dynamically adjusting encryption parameters based on detected threats.
3. **Quantum-Resistant Authentication** – Preventing unauthorized access and ensuring future-proof security.


### 1. Chaotic Key Generation and Encryption Mechanism

The encryption process is based on **chaotic systems**, which exhibit **high sensitivity to initial conditions** and generate unpredictable key sequences. 

The system is structured into three main components:

#### 1.1 True Random Number Generation (TRNG) for Initial Seed
* A **True Random Number Generator (TRNG)** collects entropy from real-world physical sources (e.g., sensor noise, electronic fluctuations, environmental changes) to produce a highly random seed which serves as the starting input for initializing the chaotic system to generate encryption keys.

#### 1.2 Chaos-Based Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CPRNG)
* Using chaotic systems like **Logistic Map, Lorenz Attractor, or Chua’s Circuit**, a **chaotic key stream** is generated. The key stream is **non-repeating and unpredictable**, making it resistant to attacks. The chaotic system ensures **non-periodicity, high sensitivity to initial conditions, and deterministic unpredictability**—making it ideal for **lightweight encryption in RTES**.

#### 1.3 Lightweight Encryption Process
* The plaintext data is encrypted using **Bitwise XOR operations** with the chaotic key stream. **Chaotic substitution and permutation techniques** for increased diffusion and confusion. Since chaotic maps are **computationally inexpensive**, this method is well-suited for RTES with limited processing power.

### **2 AI-Driven Anomaly Detection and Adaptive Security**

To provide **real-time intrusion detection and adaptive security**, a **lightweight AI model** is integrated, ensuring minimal computational overhead for RTES.

#### **2.1 Lightweight Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection**

A **compact, pre-trained anomaly detection model** continuously monitors system activity while ensuring minimal computational overhead for RTES.
 They analyze:  
1. **Network traffic behavior** for deviations from expected patterns.
2. **System operation logs** to detect unusual activity or privilege escalation.
3. **Power and computation usage** for potential side-channel attack.

Suitable **lightweight models** that can be used are:
1. **Autoencoders (AE)** – Small neural networks that reconstruct normal data patterns and flag deviations as anomalies.
2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-Based Models** – Efficient recurrent models that track temporal patterns in system logs to detect stealthy attacks.
3. **One-Class Support Vector Machines (One-Class SVM)** – A non-deep learning method that learns normal system behavior and flags anything outside it.
4. **Isolation Forest (iForest)** – A tree-based model that efficiently isolates outliers in real-time.

These models can be optimized for low-power devices through **pruning, quantization, and model distillation** to ensure **fast, memory-efficient intrusion detection**.

#### **2.2 Adaptive Encryption Parameter Adjustment**

If an anomaly is detected, the system **dynamically modifies encryption parameters** to mitigate threats by:
- **Reinitializing chaotic key generation** with a new TRNG seed for unpredictability.
- **Altering chaotic map parameters** (e.g., logistic map, Lorenz attractor) to generate a new key stream.
- **Increasing encryption complexity** proportionally to attack severity.
- **Switching authentication methods** if suspicious activity is detected in identity validation.

#### **2.3 Reinforcement Learning for Self-Optimizing Security**

- A **lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) model** (e.g., **Deep Q-Network (DQN) with reduced parameter size**) fine-tunes security settings over time.
- The model **analyzes past attack patterns** and dynamically optimizes encryption and authentication configurations.
- **Minimizes computational overhead** by selecting the **most efficient security response** for detected threats.

### **3 Quantum-Resistant Authentication and Key Exchange**

To ensure **secure access control** and **tamper-proof key exchange**, the system integrates **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)** techniques.

#### 3.1 Authentication via Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
- The system uses **lattice-based cryptographic methods** (e.g., Kyber, NTRU) to verify device identities.
- **Hash-based digital signatures (SPHINCS+)** ensure **tamper-proof authentication** without relying on conventional RSA/ECC keys.

#### 3.2 Secure Key Exchange Using Chaotic Sequences
- The encryption keys are derived from **chaotic sequences**, making them **unique for each session** and resistant to replay attacks.
- A **shared chaotic parameter** is securely exchanged using **PQC-based key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs)**.

#### 3.3 Session-Based One-Time Authentication Tokens
- The **chaotic key generation system** is used to generate **one-time authentication tokens** that are **non-reproducible** due to their sensitivity to initial conditions.
- These tokens replace **static passwords or pre-shared keys**, and they expire after each session making authentication **highly secure and resistant to replay attacks**.
