While research has explored **chaos-based encryption, ML-based anomaly detection, and PQC separately**, there is **no unified approach** that:

1. Uses **chaos-based cryptographic techniques** for lightweight and non-deterministic encryption capable of securing RTES without excessive computational overhead.
2. Incorporates integrating **machine learning-driven anomaly detection** to dynamically adjust encryption parameters based on real-time threats.
3. Ensures **quantum resistance** through integration with **post-quantum cryptographic methods** optimized for RTES and IoT Intgration.
