## **5. Limitations of the Proposed Approach**

While the proposed system offers strong encryption, adaptive security, and computational efficiency, it faces the following limitations:

### **5.1. Implementation Challenges**

**Hardware Constraints:**

- Many RTES and IoT devices operate on low-power microcontrollers with limited computational resources. Implementing chaotic key generation and AI-driven anomaly detection may require dedicated cryptographic accelerators or hardware optimization.

**Algorithm Complexity & Optimization:**

- While chaos-based encryption is computationally lightweight, ensuring real-time performance requires fine-tuning of chaotic functions. Certain chaotic maps (e.g., Lorenz attractor) require floating-point precision, which may not be available on all RTES architectures.

### **5.2. Key Synchronization Issues**

**Challenge in Securely Synchronizing Chaotic PRNGs:**

- Unlike traditional encryption, where keys are statically defined, chaotic systems require both sender and receiver to remain synchronized with the same initial conditions.
- Network delays, packet loss, or external interference may cause desynchronization, leading to decryption failures.

### **5.3. Vulnerability to Certain Attacks**

**Side-Channel Attacks on IoT Devices:**

- Although chaotic encryption minimizes computational signatures, power analysis attacks could still infer encryption patterns from hardware leakage.
- Mitigation: Integrating dynamic noise injection or shielded computation architectures.

**AI-Based Adversarial Attacks on Anomaly Detection:**

- Attackers could use adversarial ML techniques to manipulate the anomaly detection model, reducing its ability to detect cyber threats.

## **6. Potential Improvements**

To address the above limitations, the following improvements can enhance the security, efficiency, and scalability of the system:

**Exploring Hardware-Optimized Chaotic Encryption for IoT Security:**

- Current IoT security solutions rely on software-based encryption, which adds latency and energy overhead.
- Hardware-optimized chaotic PRNGs and authentication modules can significantly improve:
    - Throughput & power efficiency in IoT devices.
    - Resistance to physical tampering & side-channel attacks.

**Exploring error-correction mechanisms** and using self-recovering chaotic synchronization techniques.

**Combining Chaos-Based Encryption with Zero-Trust Architectures (ZTA):**

- Zero-Trust Architectures enforce continuous verification, ensuring chaotic encryption keys and authentication parameters are dynamically revalidated.

**Enhancing AI-Driven Threat Adaptability:**

- Current systems monitor traffic and adapt encryption parameters. However, further improvements can be made by:
    - Reinforcement Learning for self-healing security.
    - Federated Learning for decentralized threat intelligence, where RTES and IoT devices can collaboratively learn from distributed cyber threat patterns.

**Research on Quantum-Resistant Authentication Schemes:**

- Explore quantum-secure Lattice-based signatures for RTES authentication.
