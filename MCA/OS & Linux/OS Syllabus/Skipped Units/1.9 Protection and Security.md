Mechanisms ensure that files, memory segments, CPU, and other resources can be operated by only those processes that have gained proper authorization from the OS.

memory-addressing hardware
ensures that a process can execute only within its own address space. 

The timer 
ensures that no process can gain control of the CPU without eventually relinquishing control. 

Device-control registers 
are not accessible to users, so the integrity of the various peripheral devices is protected.
