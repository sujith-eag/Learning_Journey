Main memory is the repository of quickly accessible data shared by the CPU and I/O devices.

Main memory is an array of bytes, ranging to billions. Each Byte has its own address.

Main memory is the only large storage device that the CPU is able to address and access directly.
For a program to be executed, it must be mapped to absolute addresses and loaded into memory.

To improve utilization of CPU and speed of computer's response, there must be memory management.

The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connection with memory management:
• Keeping track of which parts of memory are currently being used and who is using them
• Deciding which processes (or parts of processes) and data to move into and out of memory
• Allocating and de-allocating memory space as needed
