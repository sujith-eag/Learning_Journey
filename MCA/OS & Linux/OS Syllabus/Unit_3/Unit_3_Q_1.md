- iv) Cycle state

17. Propose methods to recover the system from a deadlock situation.

18. Let a system have P1, P2, P3, P4 processes and r1 and r2 resources. Both resources have 2 instances. The set E is given by:  `E = {<P1 -> r1>, <r1 -> P2>, <r1 -> P3>, <P3 -> r2>, <r2 -> P4>, <r2 -> P1> }` Does the system lead to a deadlock?
