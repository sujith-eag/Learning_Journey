### Methods for Handling Deadlocks

There are four approaches to dealing with deadlocks:

1. **Deadlock Prevention**
2. **Deadlock Avoidance** (e.g., Banker's Algorithm)
3. **Deadlock Detection & Recovery**
4. **Deadlock Ignorance** (Ostrich Method)

### Deadlock Prevention

A deadlock occurs when all four of the following conditions are met:

- **Mutual Exclusion**
- **Hold and Wait**
- **No Preemption**
- **Circular Wait**

To prevent deadlocks, at least one of these conditions must be eliminated.
Deadlock prevention is a proactive method that, by ensuring that at least one of these conditions cannot hold, we can prevent the occurrence of a deadlock.

#### Eliminating Mutual Exclusion

- Some resources, such as a printer or mutex lock, must be exclusive.
- Eliminating mutual exclusion for such resources is impractical.

#### Prevent Deadlock by Eliminating Hold and Wait

The hold-and-wait condition occurs when a process holds at least one resource while waiting for another.

Prevention Strategies is Ensure a process requests all resources at the start and be allocated all necessary resources before it begins execution. (This is impractical due to dynamic nature of requests)

Force a process to release held resources before requesting new ones

To ensure that the hold-and-wait condition never occurs in the system, another protocol allows a thread to request resources only when it has none. 

A thread may request some resources and use them. Before it can request any additional resources, it must release all the resources that it is currently allocated. 

**Possible Starvation**: A process that needs multiple resources may have to wait indefinitely because at least one resource is always in use by another process.

#### No Preemption

- No preemption is when a resource cannot be forcefully taken (preempted) from a process holding it; the process must release it voluntarily.

To ensure this condition does not hold :     

If a thread is holding some resources and requests another resource that cannot be immediately allocated to it (that is, the thread must wait), then instead of holding and waiting, all resources the thread is currently holding are preempted and released.

The preempted resources are added to the list of resources and the thread will be restarted only when it can regain its old resources, as well as the new ones that it is requesting.

Alternatively, if a thread requests some unavailable resource held by a process waiting for some resources. We preempt the desired resources from the waiting thread and allocate them to the requesting thread.

It cannot generally be applied to such resources as mutex locks and semaphores, precisely the type of resources where deadlock occurs most commonly.
(So all three are kind of impractical solutions to prevent deadlock)

#### Prevent Deadlock by Eliminating Circular Wait

One way to ensure Circular wait condition never holds is to impose a total ordering of all resource types and to require that each thread requests resources in an increasing order of enumeration.

- Ensure a process releases lower-priority resources before requesting higher-priority resources.


____

Deadlock-prevention algorithms, prevent deadlocks by limiting how requests can be made. The limits ensure that at least one of the necessary conditions for deadlock cannot occur. Possible side effects
of preventing deadlocks by this method, however, are low device utilization and reduced system throughput.
