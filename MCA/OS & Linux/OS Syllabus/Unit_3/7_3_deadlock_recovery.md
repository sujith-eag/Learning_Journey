If a system does not employ either a deadlock-prevention or a deadlock avoidance algorithm, then a deadlock situation may occur. In this environment, the system may provide:
• An algorithm that examines the state of the system to determine whether a deadlock has occurred
• An algorithm to recover from the deadlock

A deadlock-detection algorithm can evaluate processes and resources on a running system to determine if a set of processes is in a deadlocked state.


#### 1 Single Instance of Each Resource Type

If all resources have only a single instance, then we can define a deadlock-detection algorithm that uses a variant of the resource-allocation graph, called a wait-for graph. We obtain this graph from the resource-allocation graph by removing the resource nodes and collapsing the appropriate edges.

an edge from Ti to Tj in a wait-for graph implies that thread Ti is waiting for thread Tj to release a resource that Ti needs.

a deadlock exists in the system if and only if the wait-for graph contains a cycle. To detect deadlocks, the system needs to maintain the wait-for graph and periodically invoke an algorithm that searches for a cycle in the graph. An algorithm to detect a cycle in a graph requires O(n2 ) operations, where n is the number of vertices in the graph.

The wait-for graph scheme is not applicable to a resource-allocation system with multiple instances of each resource type.

#### 3 Detection-Algorithm Usage

If deadlocks occur frequently, then the detection algorithm should be invoked frequently.

we can invoke the deadlock-detection algorithm every time a request for allocation cannot be granted immediately.

### Recovery from Deadlock

When a detection algorithm determines that a deadlock exists, there are two options for breaking a deadlock.

If deadlock does occur, a system can attempt to recover from the deadlock by either aborting one of the processes in the circular wait or preempting resources that have been assigned to a deadlocked process.

#### 1 Process termination

Abort all deadlocked processes. This method clearly will break the dead-lock cycle, but at great expense. The deadlocked processes may have computed for a long time, and the results of these partial computations must be discarded and probably will have to be recomputed later.

• Abort one process at a time until the deadlock cycle is eliminated. This method incurs considerable overhead, since after each process is aborted, a deadlock-detection algorithm must be invoked to determine whether any processes are still deadlocked.



#### 2 Resource Preemption

To eliminate deadlocks using resource preemption, we successively preempt some resources from processes and give these resources to other processes until the deadlock cycle is broken.

Three issues need to be addressed if preemption is required to deal with deadlocks.

1. Selecting a victim :  As in process termination, we must determine the order of pre-emption to minimize cost. Cost factors may include such parameters as the number of resources a deadlocked process is holding and the amount of time the process has thus far consumed.

2. Rollback : If we preempt a resource from a process, what should be done with that process? Clearly, it cannot continue with its normal execution; it is missing some needed resource. We must roll back the process to some safe state and restart it from that state. Since, in general, it is difficult to determine what a safe state is, the simplest solution is a total rollback: abort the process and then restart it. 

3. Starvation : how can we guarantee that resources will not always be preempted from the same process? In a system where victim selection is based primarily on cost factors, it may happen that the same process is always picked as a victim. As a result, this process never completes its designated task, a starvation situation any practical system must address.
