System calls can be roughly grouped int o six major categories:
• Process control
	◦ end, abort
	◦ load, execute
	◦ create process, terminate process
	◦ get process attributes, set process attributes
	◦ wait for time
	◦ wait event, signal event
	◦ allocate and free memory

• File management
	◦ create ﬁle, delete ﬁle
	◦ open, close
	◦ read, write, reposition
	◦ get ﬁle attributes, set ﬁle attributes

• Device management
	◦ request device, release device
	◦ read, write, reposition
	◦ get device attributes, set device attributes
	◦ logically attach or detach devices

• Information maintenance
	◦ get time or date, set time or date
	◦ get system data, set system data
	◦ get process, ﬁle, or device attributes
	◦ set process, ﬁle, or device attributes

• Communications
	◦ create, delete communication connection
	◦ send, receive messages
	◦ transfer status information
	◦ attach or detach remote devices


### 2.4.1 Process Control

A running program needs to be able to halt its execution either normally `end()` or abnormally `abort()`. 

Under either circumstances, the operating system must transfer
control to the invoking command interpreter. 

The command interpreter then reads the next command. 

> If a system call is made to terminate the currently running program abnormally, or if the program runs into a problem and causes an error trap, a dump of memory is sometimes taken and an error message generated. 
> The dump is written to disk and may be examined by a debugger to determine the cause of the problem. 


In an interactive system, the command interpreter simply continues with the next command; it is assumed that the user will issue an appropriate command to respond to any error. 

In a GUI system, a pop-up window might alert the user to the error and ask for guidance. 

In a batch system, the command interpreter usually terminates the entire job and continues with the next job.

### 2.4.2 File Management

`create()` and `delete()` file both need name of the file and some file attributes.
`open()` for opening a file that is created.
`read()` `write()` `reposition()` (rewind or skip to the end of the file)
`close()`
