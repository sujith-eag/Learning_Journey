### **UNIT – II**  
**3.**  
a) Consider the following set of processes, with the length of the CPU-burst time given in milliseconds:  

| Process | Burst Time | Priority |
|---------|------------|----------|
| P1      | 8          | 3        |
| P2      | 1          | 1        |
| P3      | 2          | 3        |
| P4      | 1          | 4        |
| P5      | 4          | 2        |

The processes are assumed to have arrived in the order P1, P2, P3, P5, and P4 all at time 0.  
i) Draw four Gantt Charts illustrating the execution of these processes using FCFS, SJF, a non-preemptive priority (a smaller priority number implies a higher priority), and RR (quantum = 2) scheduling.  
ii) What is the waiting time of each process for each of the scheduling algorithms?  
iii) What is the turnaround time of each process for each of the scheduling algorithms?  

b) Exemplify semaphores. State their usage and implementation.  

**4.**  
a) Describe the issues that have to be considered while scheduling approaches to multiple processor scheduling.  
b) Define the critical section problem. Exemplify the three requirements for a solution to the critical-section problem.

### **UNIT – III**  
**5.**  
a) What is a deadlock? Explain the Readers-Writers Problem with code snippets and explain how the deadlock is avoided in the scenario.  
b) Illustrate any two page-replacement algorithms for the following reference string:  
   \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \)  

**6.**  
a) Exemplify the process of paging and segmentation of memory.  
b) Explain the dining philosophers problem with code snippets and explain how the deadlock situation is avoided in the problem.

### **UNIT – IV**  

**7.**  
a) Explain the file system and state the different allocation methods to files.  
b) Summarize the means of file sharing implemented in a client-server model and distributed information systems.  

**8.**  
a) Illustrate the directory structure and file system mounting with diagrams.  
b) Describe the different techniques for free-space management.

### **UNIT – V**  
**9.**  
a) Suppose that a disk drive has 5000 cylinders, numbered 0 to 4999. This drive is currently serving a request at cylinder 143, and the previous request was at cylinder 125. The queue of pending requests in FIFO order is:  
   \( 86, 1470, 913, 1774, 948, 1509, 1022, 1750, 130 \)  
   Starting from the current head position, what is the total distance (in cylinders) that the disk arm moves to satisfy all the pending requests for each of the following disk scheduling algorithms?  
   - SSTF  
   - SCAN  

b) Summarize the principles of system protection and domains of system protection.  

**10.**  
a) Define Access Matrix for protection and explain how it is implemented.  
b) Illustrate how swap space management is implemented.
