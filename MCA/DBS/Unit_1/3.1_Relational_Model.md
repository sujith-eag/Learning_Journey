# Relational Model Concepts

The **relational model** represents the database as a collection of **relations**. Informally, each relation resembles a **table of values** or, to some extent, a **flat file** of records. It is called a flat file because each record has a simple linear or flat structure.

When a relation is thought of as a table of values:

- Each **row** represents a collection of related data values.
    
- A row typically corresponds to a real-world **entity** or **relationship**.
    

In formal relational model terminology:

- A **row** is called a **tuple**.
    
- A **column header** is called an **attribute**.
    
- The **table** is called a **relation**.
    
- The data type that defines the set of values for a column is called a **domain**.

### Domain

A **domain (D)** is a set of **atomic values**.

- **Atomic** means each value in the domain is **indivisible** as far as the relational model is concerned.
    
- A **datatype or format** is specified for each domain.

### Relation Schema

A **relation schema (R)** is denoted by:  
**R(A1, A2, A3, ..., An)**

Where:

- **R** is the name of the relation.
    
- **A1, A2, ..., An** are the attributes.
    
- Each attribute **Ai** is associated with a domain **D**, denoted as **dom(Ai)**.
    
- The **degree** or **arity** of a relation is the number of attributes **n** in the schema.

### Relation Instance

A **relation instance (r)** of the schema **R(A1, A2, A3, ..., An)** — denoted as **r(R)** — is a set of **n-tuples**:

**r = {t1, t2, t3, ..., tm}**

Each **n-tuple t** is an ordered list of **n values**:  
**t = ⟨v1, v2, v3, ..., vn⟩**

Where:

- Each **vi** (1 ≤ i ≤ n) is a value from **dom(Ai)** or a special **NULL** value.

## 2.2 Characteristics of Relations

1. **Ordering of tuples** in a relation:  
    Tuples are not ordered in a relation. The order in which tuples appear is not significant.
    
2. **Ordering of values within a tuple:**  
    Although tuples are unordered in a set, the position of values within a tuple matters, as it corresponds to attributes.
    
3. **Values and NULLs in tuples:**  
    Each value in a tuple is from the domain of its attribute or can be **NULL**, representing unknown or inapplicable values.

## 2.3 Relational Model Notation

The following notation is commonly used:

1. A **relation schema R** of degree **n** is denoted by:  
    **R(A1, A2, A3, ..., An)**
    
2. Uppercase letters **Q, R, S** denote **relation names**.
    
3. Lowercase letters **q, r, s** denote **relation states** (instances of relations).
    
4. Letters **t, u, v** denote **tuples**.
    
5. The **name of a relation schema** (e.g., `STUDENT`) also refers to the **current set of tuples** (state) in that relation.
    
6. An **attribute A** belonging to a relation **R** can be **qualified** using dot notation:  
    **R.A**
    
7. An **n-tuple t** in a relation instance **r(R)** is denoted as:  
    **t = ⟨v1, v2, ..., vn⟩**,  
    where each **vi** corresponds to the value of attribute **Ai**.
    
8. Tuples can also be denoted using **named attributes**:
    
    - Example:  
        **t[Name] = ⟨'Barbara Benson'⟩**  
        **t[Ssn, Gpa, Age] = ⟨'533-69-1238', 3.25, 19⟩**
