## Introduction to Databases

A **database** is a structured collection of related data.

By **data**, we refer to known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning—such as names, telephone numbers, and addresses.

### Key Characteristics of a Database

A database has the following implicit properties:

- **Represents a Miniworld (Universe of Discourse - UoD):**  
    A database represents some aspect of the real world. This real-world context is sometimes called the **miniworld** or **universe of discourse**. Any changes occurring in the miniworld are intended to be reflected in the database.
    
- **Logical Coherence:**  
    A database is a logically coherent collection of data with inherent meaning. A random or unorganized collection of data is **not** considered a database.
    
- **Purpose-Driven Design:**  
    A database is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose. It serves an intended group of users and is built with predefined applications in mind.


A database has some source from which data is derived, some degree of interaction with events in the real world, and an audience that is actively interested in its contents.

## Database Management System (DBMS)

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a computerized software system that enables users to **create**, **define**, **construct**, **manipulate**, and **share** databases.

### Core Functions of a DBMS

1. **Defining the Database:**  
    This includes specifying data types, structures, and constraints. The definition or descriptive information (metadata) is stored in a **database catalog** or **data dictionary**.
    
2. **Constructing the Database:**  
    This involves storing the data on a storage medium managed by the DBMS.
    
3. **Manipulating the Database:**  
    Operations include:
    - **Querying** to retrieve specific data.
    - **Updating** to reflect changes in the miniworld.
    - **Generating reports** or summaries based on the data.
    
4. **Sharing the Database:**  
    Multiple users and applications can access the database concurrently in a controlled manner.
    
5. **Protection and Maintenance:**
    
    - **System protection** against hardware/software failures.
        
    - **Security protection** against unauthorized or malicious access.
        
    - Long-term **maintenance**, as databases often have life cycles spanning many years.

## Interaction with the Database

Application programs interact with the database by sending **queries** and **transactions** to the DBMS.

- A **query** is a request to retrieve specific data.
    
- A **transaction** may involve both reading and writing data.

The DBMS processes these requests, ensuring data consistency, integrity, and security.

## Database System

A **database system** consists of:

- The **database** itself.
    
- The **DBMS software**.
    
- Application programs and user interfaces.

Together, they support the creation, usage, and maintenance of databases.

## Database Design Process

Designing a database, whether for a new application or an existing one, involves several stages:

1. **Requirements Specification and Analysis:**  
    Collecting and documenting the data needs of users and applications.
    
2. **Conceptual Design:** 
    Creating a high-level data model (e.g., Entity-Relationship model) that can be manipulated using design tools. This stage helps in maintaining and evolving the design.
    
3. **Logical Design:**  
    Translating the conceptual model into a logical model supported by the DBMS (e.g., relational model).
    
4. **Physical Design:**  
    Defining storage structures, indexing, access methods, and other physical considerations for efficient data access.
    
5. **Implementation and Maintenance:**  
    The database is implemented, populated with real data, and maintained over time to reflect ongoing changes in the miniworld.
