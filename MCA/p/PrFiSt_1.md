**IoT-based animal health monitoring system** using **machine learning** to detect illness based on motion and behavior data

___
## Basic Flow of Program Events


### **Animal Input & Profile Setup**

1. **Animal ID Assignment**: Assign a unique ID to each animal to track its data consistently. This step is critical before or as part of data entry to ensure each animal's data is uniquely identifiable.
2. **Data Validation**: Ensure that all input data (age, breed, health status, etc.) is validated to prevent incorrect or incomplete entries.
3. **Health History Input**: Input any previous illnesses or medical history that could help in anomaly detection. This historical data can provide context for detecting future health issues.
4. **Behavioral & Health Baseline**: Define the animal's initial behaviors (e.g., resting heart rate, eating habits) and health conditions, which will be used for comparison when abnormalities are detected.

### **Tracker Setup & Configuration**

1. **Tracker Configuration and Calibration**: Calibrate the trackers (accelerometers, gyroscopes) based on the animal’s unique needs, such as size, activity level, and physiological requirements.
2. **Fault Detection**: Continuously monitor tracker performance for issues like low battery or signal loss to maintain data integrity and reliable functioning.
3. **Environmental Considerations**: Ensure trackers are rugged and able to withstand environmental stresses, such as temperature changes and external wear.

---

### **Network Connectivity**
1. **WiFi/Network Provider Setup**: Connect the trackers to a stable network that handles raw data transmission, using secure networking protocols for traffic management.
2. **Data Transmission**: Pass unprocessed raw data from unique trackers to the backend system for further processing.
3. **Real-Time Data**: Capture and transmit real-time data regarding the animal’s position and motion (e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope readings) to ensure accurate tracking.

---

### **Backend System**

1. **Raw Data Storage**: Collect and store raw data in a structured format, tied to the unique animal ID for traceability.
2. **Data Translation**: Translate the raw data into behavioral patterns and movements, applying predefined quantifiers and logic that are unique to each animal and based on its baseline.
3. **Processed Data Storage**: Store the processed data alongside the animal's unique ID and a time reference, enabling accurate tracking over time.
4. **Data Summary**: Consolidate daily data into a summarized format, making it easily accessible for future analysis or comparison.

### **Machine Learning (ML) Processing**

1. **Model Training**: Train an ML model to analyze raw data and predict actions or events for each individual animal. This includes regular updates based on newly collected data.
2. **Healthy Base Model Creation**: Create a standard baseline of healthy behaviors for each animal, using historical data for reference. The model should be regularly updated to reflect changes in the animal's health over time.
3. **Real-Time Behavior Comparison**: Compare new raw data with the standard healthy base to detect behavioral changes or health anomalies.
4. **Tuning for Accuracy**: Tune the model's output to consider all possible variables, including external events, to ensure correct predictions.
5. **Anomaly Detection**: Train the model to recognize movement patterns or behavioral characteristics that may indicate an animal is unwell, and compare incoming raw data against these patterns to trigger alerts.
6. **Real-Time Processing**: The processing database is updated in real-time to reflect the latest data, with the model continually assessing the animal’s status based on preset parameters.
7. **Feedback Loop**: Provide the ability to validate or correct the model's predictions through user feedback, improving the accuracy of future reports and alert generation.

### **Database Management**

1. **Data Archiving & Backup**: Implement periodic archiving of data for long-term analysis and backup systems to prevent data loss.
2. **Structured Data Format**: Ensure data is stored in structured formats like JSON or XML for easy retrieval via APIs.

---

### **Pre-Backend Server**

1. **API Management**: Handle authentication, rate limiting, and session management (cookies and timeouts) to ensure secure and efficient data access.
2. **Data Retrieval**: Interpret API calls to retrieve individual animal data or generate general average data based on the animal ID as requested by the frontend.
3. **Structured Data Delivery**: Pass the requested data in a structured format (JSON or XML) to the frontend for display and further analysis.

---

### **Frontend User Interface**

1. **User Authentication**: Secure user login with role-based permissions (admin, veterinarian, user) to ensure controlled access to data.
2. **Tracker Management**: Allow users to add, update, or remove trackers as needed, ensuring they can manage the system efficiently.
3. **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Display movement patterns, heart rate, and other relevant data in easy-to-understand graphical formats for immediate assessment.
4. **Alert Management & Feedback**: Provide alerts for behaviors that need attention, and allow users to validate or provide feedback on the accuracy of the reports. This assists in model updating and continuous learning.
5. **Health Trends Dashboard**: Provide long-term data visualization to help identify potential health issues or trends over weeks or months.
6. **Data Export**: Enable users to download reports or raw data for further analysis or record-keeping.

---

### **Additional Features**

1. **Testing & Validation**: Run controlled tests to validate the system’s functionality and stress-test the system for scalability.
2. **Integration with External Medical Systems**: Integrate with veterinary software for a more comprehensive view of animal health, potentially automating the generation and export of alerts.
3. **Behavioral Context Awareness**: Factor in environmental variables (e.g., weather, time of day, external stressors) that may impact behavior, improving anomaly detection accuracy.

---

### **Final Outcome**

1. **Real-Time Alerts**: Send alerts to authorized personnel (e.g., caretakers, veterinarians) when potential health issues are detected.
2. **Report Generation**: Generate detailed reports that include movement data, anomaly detection results, and suggested actions for the caretakers or veterinarians.
3. **Disease Prediction**: Over time, the system can predict the likelihood of specific illnesses based on detected patterns and historical data, helping with proactive health management.
