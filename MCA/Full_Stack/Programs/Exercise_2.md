**Exercise 2 â€“ React JS**

**(Components, Lists, Keys, prop validation and CSS)**

  
  

1. Design a class-based React-JS component called CourseCard that receives props such as course title (string), duration in weeks (number), and instructor name (string). Use prop-types to validate that all props are required and of the correct type.
  

2. Build a functional component in React-JS that renders a grid of famous landmarks (name, location, country). Use external CSS to apply styles like borders, spacing, and hover effects to each item.
    
3. Design a React class component with prop validation using PropTypes to ensure correct data types for props?

```
type       value          valid
Array       1,2,3,4,5      true
Boolean     False          true
Function     50            true
String       GFG           true
Number        100          true
```
