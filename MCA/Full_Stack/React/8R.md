### Transpiling JSX

You donâ€™t need to set up your own transpiler. However, if you want to set up a React project from scratch, you can, and that would include setting up a JSX transpiler. The most popular tool out there to do JSX transpiling is Babel, but there are alternatives you might want to look at as well.

* Babel: https://babeljs.io/
* SWC: https://swc.rs/
* Sucrase: https://sucrase.io/
* esbuild: https://esbuild.github.io/

### React and JSX gotchas

This section covers some edge cases and oddities that you should be aware of when you use JSX:
* Self-closing tags are required for leaf nodes.
* Special characters are written literally.
* String conversion is a bit peculiar.
* The style attribute is an object.
* Some attributes have reserved names and must be renamed. `class` can't be used so `className`.
* Multiword attributes are in camelCase.
* Boolean attributes are handled differently than in HTML.
* Some whitespace is collapsed (but not all).
* You can add data- attributes where desired.
