### Branching in JSX

Branching is always important in coding. For example, if the user is logged in, show their account information; otherwise, show a login form. 

Some patterns have emerged that most developers follow about how to use branching in React components using JSX:
* Use early return for rendering nothing.
* Use the ternary operator for rendering alternative elements.
* Use the logical AND operator (&&) for rendering optional elements.
* Use object maps for rendering between many different elements.
* Use extra components for more complex branching.

#### Use early return for rendering nothing.

A countdown component that renders a value only when the number of remaining seconds is larger than 0.

If a component doesn’t render anything, we can simply return null from the component.

```jsx
class Countdown extends React.Component
{
	render()
	{
		const seconds = this.props.remains % 60;
		const minutes = Math.floor(this.props.remains/60);
		const message = <p>{minutes}:{seconds}</p>;
		
		if(seconds>0 || minutes >0 )
		{
			return message;
		}
		else
		{
			return null;
		}
	}
}
```


you’ll see many developers use the approach of aborting early if the component renders nothing.

```jsx
class Countdown extends Component 
{
	render()
	{
		if(this.props.remains === 0)
		{
			return null;
		}
		const seconds = this.props.remains % 60;
		const minutes = Math.floor(this.props.remains/60);
		return <p>{minutes}:{seconds}</p>;	
	}
}
```

#### Using ternary for Alternative

A shopping cart in which we want to display the items if there are any items, but display a message saying there are no items when no items are in the cart.

This can be done with if else or using ternary operator.

`<p>User is {this.props.isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline'}</p>`

```jsx
class ShoppingCart extends Component 
{
	render()
	{
		return (
		<aside>
			<h1>Shopping cart</h1>
			{this.props.items.length === 0 ? (
				<p>Your cart is empty.</p>)
				: (<CartItems items={this.props.items} />
				)}
		</aside>
		);
	}
}
```



#### Use the logical operator for optional  rendering

Another common pattern is the need to optionally render an element if a condition is true, but render nothing if not true.

we want to display a little check-mark next to a username if the user is a verified user, but nothing for the unverified plebeians.

when doing `a && b`, JavaScript returns a if a is falsy or b if a is truthy.

```jsx
class UserName extends Component 
{
	render() 
	{
		return (
			<p>
			{this.props.username}
			{this.props.isVerified && <Checkmark />}
			</p>
		);
	}
}
```


#### Using Objects for Switching

If we want to render more than two types of elements based on a condition

```jsx
class PostStatus extends Component 
{
	render() 
	{
		return this.props.status === "draft" ?
			<DraftIcon /> :
			this.props.status === "published" ?
			<PublishedIcon /> :
			<TrashIcon />;
	}
}
```

A more declarative approach here is to use an object with properties for the different cases resolving the
different outcomes:

```jsx
const status2icon = 
{
	draft: <DraftIcon />,
	published: <PublishedIcon />,
	deleted: <TrashIcon />,
};

class PostStatus extends Component 
{
	render() 
	{
		return status2icon[this.props.status] 
		|| status2icon.deleted;
	}
}
```

To handle the case when the status is any other unexpected value, we add a logical OR at the end so that if the object indexing resolves to nothing, we still render an alternative.

### Using Extra components for Complex Branching

Let’s say we have a shopping cart component like before with some buttons at the bottom. 

We have to implement the following business logic as dictated by a customer:
* If the user is logged in, there will be just a Checkout button.
* If the user isn’t logged in, there will be a Login button as well as a Checkout as Guest button.
* If any item is out of stock or if the cart is empty, the Checkout or the Checkout as Guest button will be disabled.
* If the user is logged in but hasn’t added a credit card yet, show an Add Credit Card button instead.
* If the user is logged in, has a credit card on file, and has entered an address, show a One-Click Buy button next to the Checkout button. This button will be disabled according to the same logic as the Checkout button.

```jsx
import { Component, Fragment } from 'react';

class ShoppingCart extends Component
{
	render()
	{
		const hasItems = this.props.items.length > 0;
		const isLoggedIn = this.props.user !== null;
		const hasCreditCard = isLoggedIn && this.props.user.creditcard !== null;
		const hasAddress = isLoggedIn && this.props.user.address !== null;
		const isAvailable = this.props.items.every((item) => !item.outOfStock);
		
		
		return isLoggedIn ? (
			hasCreditCard ? (
				<Fragmet>
					<button disabled={ !hasItems || !isAvailable}>
					Checkout
					</button>
					{hasAddress && (
					<button>
						disabled={!hasItems || !isAvailable}
						One-click buy
						</button>
					)}
				</Fragment>
				) : (
					<button>Add credit card</button>
				) : (
					<Fragment>
					 <button>Login</button>
					 <button disabled={!hasItems || !isAvailable}>
						 Checkout as guest
					</button>
					</Fragment>
				);
		
		);
		
	}
}

class App extends Component
{
	render()
	{
		const items = [1,2,3];
		const user = { creditcard: null, address: true };
		return <ShoppingCart items={items} user={user} />;
	}
}

export default App;
```

this is getting a bit complicated with the nested conditionals and duplicated attributes. For such a complex case, it’s often a good idea to split things into multiple components that deal with each of the different cases one by one.

we can create new components `<UserButtons />` and `<GuestButtons />`. At the top level, we can select which of these components to use and then add the necessary extra checks and conditionals inside each of these.


```jsx
import { Component, Fragment } from "react";

class UserButtons extends Component 
{
	render() 
	{
		const hasCreditCard = this.props.user.creditcard !== null;
		
		const hasAddress = this.props.user.address !== null;

		const disabled = !this.props.canCheckout;

		return hasCreditCard ? (
			<Fragment>
			<button disabled={disabled}>Checkout</button>
			{hasAddress && (
				<button disabled={disabled}>One-click buy</button>
			)}
			</Fragment>
		) : (
			<button>Add credit card</button>
		);
	}
}


class GuestButtons extends Component 
{
	render() 
	{
		return (
			<Fragment>
				<button>Login</button>
				<button disabled={!this.props.canCheckout}>
					Checkout as guest
				</button>
			</Fragment>
		);
	}
}


class ShoppingCart extends Component 
{
	render() 
	{
		const hasItems = this.props.items.length > 0;
		const isLoggedIn = this.props.user !== null;
		const isAvailable = this.props.items.every((item) => !item.outOfStock);
		
		const canCheckout = hasItems && isAvailable;
		
		return isLoggedIn ? (
			<UserButtons user={this.props.user} canCheckout={canCheckout} />
		) : (
			<GuestButtons canCheckout={canCheckout} />
		);
	}
}


class App extends Component 
{
	render() 
	{
		const items = [1, 2, 3];
		const user = { creditcard: null, address: true };
		
		return <ShoppingCart items={items} user={user} />;
	}
}

export default App;
```

#### Comments in JSX

Because JSX is written inside of JavaScript, you can use regular JavaScript comments outside the JSX elements as normal:
```jsx
// This is the page title
const title = <h1>Hello world!</h1>;
```

To add comments inline inside the JSX you can’t always use a regular JavaScript comment directly.

To add JSX comments between tags, you can wrap standard JavaScript comments using `/**/` or `// in {}`,

```jsx
const content = (
	<div>
		{// single line, but closing in new line
			}
		{/* Just like JS comment
			which can spann lines*/}
	</div>
);
```

### Lists of JSX Objects

we can just use the item value as the key property on the root element returned inside the mapped array.

```jsx
import { Component } from "react";

class App extends Component {
	render()
	{
		const items = ["apples" "pears", "playstations"];
		
		return <Select items={items} />;
	}
}

class Select extends Component {
	render()
	{
		return (
			<select>
				{this.props.items.map( (item)=> (
					<option key={item}>{item}</option>
					))}
			</select>
		);
	}
}

export default App;
```

```
{this.props.items.map( (item)=> (
	<option key={item}>{item}</option> ) 
	)}
``` 

for every element in the items array, returns a JSX element.

This key property is an internal React property that will never be rendered to the DOM. It’s recommended that the key property is some unique identifier for the element in question and not just the index of the element in the array.

>[!note]
>Keys are local to the individual array, so they only have to be unique within each array, not between all arrays in your application or even your component.


his is a fairly complicated feature of React to understand at this point, so, for now, just be aware that if you get a warning in the console about a missing key property or duplicate keys, this is the reason when key property is not assigned.

___

### Fragments in JSX

They’re used to export multiple elements at the same level in a situation where only a single element is allowed.

```jsx
import { Fragment } from 'react';

...
return (
	<Fragment>
		<h1>Hello and welcome</h1>
		<a href="/blog">Go to the blog</a>
	</Fragment>
);
```

However, from React 16.2 (and Babel 7) forward, a shorter syntax is also allowed. Now you don’t even have to import the Fragment component:

```jsx
return (
	<>
		<h1>Hello and welcome</h1>
		<a href="/blog">Go to the blog</a>
	</>
);
```

This new shorthand syntax uses a seemingly empty tag to render fragments. This syntax with `<></>` can’t take any attributes or properties, however. 

The only property you might want to apply to this would be key because you’re rendering a list of elements, where each element has more than a single JSX element at the root.


___

if we create an application to render three dog breeds with a little description about each, we need to map our dog breed names and definitions to two elements. We do that by wrapping them in a fragment, but because we need the fragment to have a key property, we have to use the literal Fragment component and, unfortunately, can’t use the shorthand syntax mentioned previously.

```jsx
import { Component, Fragment } from "react";

class App extends Component 
{
	render() 
	{
		const list = [
			{ breed: "Chihuahua", description: "Small breed of dog." },
			{ breed: "Corgi", description: "Cute breed of dog." },
			{ breed: "Cumberland Sheepdog", description: "Extinct breed of dog."},
		];
		
		return <Breeds list={list} />;
	}
}


class Breeds extends Component
{
	render()
	{
		return (
			<dl>
				{this.props.list.map(
					({breed, description }) => (
						<Fragment key={breed}>
							<dt>{breed}</dt>
							<dd>{description}</dd>
						</Fragment>	
					)	
				)}
			</dl>
		);
	}
}
export default App;
```
