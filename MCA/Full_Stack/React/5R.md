### The Special property: children

React elements take a special property, children. This isn’t a property you specify in the normal way, but you do use it as any other property.


Let’s say we want the framework for React to be displayed in bold.

`React.createElement("strong", null, "React");`


But how to pass it to a property, this can be done by creating a node for the react framework
```js
const boldReact = React.createElement(
	"strong", null, "React"
);

const link1 = React.createElement(
	Link,
	{
		framework: boldReact,
		// passing element instead of text
		url: "//react.dev"
	}
);
```
That’s a bit weird, though. We’re now creating elements, but passing them in as properties, which isn’t what we normally do.

All the nodes passed as the children to a custom element are accessible through `this.props.children`. That property is either a single node (if only passed one child element) or an array of nodes (if passed multiple child elements).

let’s change our root component to contain three links, where link text isn’t passed in as a property named framework, but rather as a child node.

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

class Link extends Component
{
	render()
	{
		const link = React.createElement
		(
			"a",
			{ href: this.props.url },
			this.props.children
		// using children as any other property
		);
		return React.createElement
		(
			"p",
			null,
			link
		);
	}
}

const boldReact = React.createElement
(
	"strong", null, "React"
);

const link1 = React.createElement
( 
	Link, { url: "//react.dev" }, boldReact
	// One named property and a child node which
	// will become the children property 
);

const link2 = React.createElement
( 
	Link, { url: "//vuejs.org" }, "Vue"
	// here child node is just text node
);

const link3 = React.createElement
( 
	Link, { url: "//angular.io" }, "Angular"
);

const group = React.createElement
(
	React.Fragment,
	null,
	link1, link2, link3
);

const domElement = document.getElementById("root");

ReactDOM.createRoot(domElement).render(group);
```


The distinction between using a normal property and the children property might seem insignificant at this point, but when we start using JSX, it makes lot more sense.

#### Application Structure

Following the default structure, we won’t have to touch `src/index.js` again at all.

So rewriting the files into sections in `src/index.js`, `src/App.js`

destructure some properties from the React namespace to shorten our component definition slightly.

```js
// src/App.js

import React, { Fragment, Component } from "react";

class Link extends Component
{
	render()
	{
		return React.createElement
		(
			"p",
			null,
			React.createElement
			(
				"a",
				{ href: this.props.url },
				`Read more about ${this.props.framework}`
			)
		);
	}
}

// App component to render the root of application
class App extends Component
{
	render()
	{
		const link1 = React.createElement
		(
			Link,
			{framework: "React", url: "//react.dev"}
		);
		
		const link2 =  ;
		const link3 =  ;
		
		return React.createElement(
			Fragment, null, link1, link2, link3
			);
		// App component return a single element
	}
}

export default App;
// App.js, we export App component as single accessible asset
```

```js
// src.index.js

import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

import App from "./App";

createRoot( document.getElementById("root"))
	.render(React.createElement(App));
```

When we need to grow, we can just create new files and import those as needed. Although it’s customary to create a single file per component and name the file after the component (including the uppercase first letter), it isn’t a strict rule. If a component needs several other small components to function, you can freely decide whether you want to put it all in one file, as we did with Link and App. or split it up into multiple files.


```js
// src/Link.js

import React, { Component } from "react";

class Link extends Component
{
	render()
	{
		return React.createElement
		(
			"p",
			null,
			React.createElement
			(
				"a",
				{ href: this.props.url },
				`Read more about ${this.props.framework}`
			)
		);
	}
}

export default Link;  // component exported
```


```js
// src/App.js

import React, { Fragment, Component } from "react";

import Link from "./Link"; // importing component

// App component to render the root of application
class App extends Component
{
	render()
	{
		const link1 = React.createElement
		(
			Link,
			{framework: "React", url: "//react.dev"}
		);
		
		const link2 =  ;
		const link3 =  ;
		
		return React.createElement(
			Fragment, null, link1, link2, link3
			);
		// App component return a single element
	}
}

export default App;
// App.js, we export App component as single accessible asset
```

When projects grow even larger, folder structures are introduced. There are no defined standards for how to use folders to structure a React project, so teams often come up with their own best practices.
