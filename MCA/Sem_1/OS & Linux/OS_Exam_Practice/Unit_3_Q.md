### Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) and System State

  ii) Aborted state  
  iii) Claim edge  
  iv) Cycle state

### System Models and Analysis

- Let a system have P1, P2, P3, P4 processes and r1 and r2 resources. Both resources have 2 instances. The set E is given by:  
`E = {<P1 -> r1>, <r1 -> P2>, <r1 -> P3>, <P3 -> r2>, <r2 -> P4>, <r2 -> P1>}`
  Does the system lead to a deadlock?
  
- In a real computer system, neither the resources available nor the demands of processes for resources remain consistent over long periods. If deadlock is controlled by the Banker’s algorithm, analyze whether the following changes can be made safely, and under what circumstances:  
  i) Increase Available (new resources added)  
  ii) Decrease Available (resource permanently removed)  
  iii) Increase Max for one process (the process may need more resources)  
  iv) Decrease Max for one process (the process needs fewer resources)  
  v) Increase the number of processes  
  vi) Decrease the number of processes
