#### 1.3.1 Single Processor System

All single processors have other specific purpose processors. But a single main processor.

___

#### 1.3.2 Multiprocessor System

Parallel systems, multi-core systems.

***Graceful degradation*** is Increased reliability and the ability to continue providing service proportional to the level of surviving hardware.

***Fault tolerance*** is beyond graceful degradation as failure of one part can still allow continuation of the process.

***Asymmetric multiprocessor*** is where each processor is assigned some task. A boss processor control the system.

***Symmetric multiprocessing*** in which each processor performs all tasks within the operating system. With no hierarchy.

> ***Blade Servers*** consist of multiple independent multiprocessor systems. Multiple processor boards, I/O boards and networking boards are placed in the same chassis. Boards can boot independently and run different OS.

___

#### 1.3.3 Clustered System

Clustered system gathers together multiple CPU's. They share storage and are closely linked via a local area network.

Clustering is usually used to provide ***High-availability*** service.

***Hot-standby mode*** where one machine just monitor the running server and becomes active only if the server fails.
