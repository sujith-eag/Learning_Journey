* A Program in execution is a process. It is an active entity.
* Program by itself is not a process, it is a passive entity, like contents of a file stored on a disk.
* A process is the unit of work in a system.

A process needs certain resources—including CPU time, memory, ﬁles, and I/O devices—to accomplish its task. These resources are either given to the process when it is created or allocated to it while it is running.

A System consists of a collection of processes, some are OS processes (executing system code) and rest are user processes.

The OS is responsible for the following activities in connection with the process management.
• Scheduling processes and threads on the CPUs
• Creating and deleting both user and system processes
• Suspending and resuming processes
• Providing mechanisms for process synchronization
• Providing mechanisms for process communication


> A compiler, a word-processing program, system task like sending output to a printer all are processes.
