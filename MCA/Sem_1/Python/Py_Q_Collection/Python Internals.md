**Q1**    
a) Mention the types of operators in Python. Define Membership operator and Identity Operator.
b) Develop a factorial function which returns the factorial of a number.
c) Develop a Python program to check if a string is a palindrome or not.

**Q2**
a) Design a function to find the average of the best two test scores out of three test scores taken as input.

b) Perform various list operations (insert an element at the beginning, at an index position, and at the end; delete an element at the end and at an index position).
```
scores = [5, 4, 7, 3, 6, 2, 1]

write the python instruction
i. to perform the following operations:
Insert an element 9 at the beginning of the list.
ii. Insert an element 8 at the index position 3 of the list.
iii. Insert an element 10 at the end of the list.
iv. Delete an element at the end of the list.
v. Delete an element at the index position 3
```
c) Discuss the following ways of passing parameters to functions with suitable examples:
- i. Keyword only parameters
- ii. Variable length arguments

**Q3**
a) Predict the output of the following and justify your answers:
```
i) 
s = "Visvesvaraya"; 
print(s[4:]) 
print(s[:5])

ii)
str1 = "Bangalore";
str1[1] = "e"
str1[6] = str1[8] = "u"
print(str1)

iii)
a = -45
print(--a)

iv)
a, b, c = True, False, False
if a or b and c:
	print("MSRIT")
else:

**Q1**  
a) Mention the data types in Python with an example for each.  
b) Write a program to count the total number of digits and the sum of digits in a number using a while loop.  
c) Develop a recursive Python function that recursively computes the sum of elements in a list of lists. Sample input: 
`[1, [2, [3, 4]], [5, 6]]`. Expected result: `21`.

**Q2**  
a) Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions:  
	The number must be divisible by five.  
	If the number is greater than 150, skip it and move to the next number.  
	If the number is greater than 500, stop the loop.  

b) Develop a Python program to print unique elements in a list.  

c) Discuss the following ways of passing parameters to functions with suitable examples:  
	i. Keyword only parameters  
	ii. Default arguments

**Q3**  
a) Predict the output of the following and justify your answers:  
i) `22 < "A"`  
ii) `i = 5`; `print("welcome") if i > 5 else print("bye")`  
iii) `[1, 2] in [0, 1, 2, 3]`  
iv) `s = "programming"`; `print(str[5:-2])`  
v) `ls = [34, 'hi', -5]`; `ls.sort()`  

b) List and describe any 4 methods on dictionaries.  

c) Write a lambda function for each of the following:  
i. Take one argument and return true if it is nonzero.  
ii. Take two arguments and return their sum.  
iii. Take three arguments and return true if the product of the first two is less than or equal to the third.
