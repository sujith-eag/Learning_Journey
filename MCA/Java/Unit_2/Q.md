shape and declare appropriate data members and abstract method to
find the area. Implement this interface in three classes namely circle,
triangle and square to compute the area. (6)

b. Illustrate an example to create a user defined package and import the same package. (8)

c. List any four Java built-in Exception. (4)

___

Unit 2

a. What are protected members? Illustrate with an example access protected members in package. (8)

b. How to create your own exceptions. Illustrate. (8)

b. Does Java support Multiple inheritance? If yes illustrate how to
achieve the same. (6)

c. Differentiate Throw, Throws and finally in Java Exceptions. Give
example. (8)

___

Unit 2

a. Develop a java program:
 Create a package named shape.

common shapes like Square, Triangle, and Circle.

to withdraw the amount and balance is less than Rs.500. (6)
