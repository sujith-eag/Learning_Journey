> Packages and Interfaces: Packages, Access Protection, An Access Example Importing Packages, Interfaces, Default Interface methods.

## Packages, 

a. How to define package? Why do we need package? With the help of java program explain the process of defining and executing package. (6)


## Access Protection, An Access Example Importing Packages, 

a. Illustrate with an example access protected members in package. (6)

a. List the different access specifies? Illustrate access specifies with respect to class members. (6)

b. Fill the following table and also illustrate with an example. (10)

```
Access Levels
			Private    No modifier   Protected  Public
Same class
Same package subclass
Same package non-subclass
Different package subclass
Different subclass non-package
```



a. Develop the java program to create a package and import it in other program. (8)

b. Illustrate an example to create a user defined package and import the same package. (8)



a. Write a program using packages to show the visibility of the variables using various types of access specifiers in Java. (6)

a. What are protected members? Illustrate with an example access protected members in package. (8)



a. Create a Balance class and organize it into a package. Demonstrate access protection and importing packages with this class. Write a program to show how classes from different packages interact. (10)




a. Develop a java program:
1. Create a package named shape.
2. Create some classes in the package representing some common shapes like Square, Triangle, and Circle.
3. Import and compile these classes in other program. (8)


## Interfaces, Default Interface methods.


b. Discuss the significance of interface in Java. Illustrate with an example. (10)

b. What is the use of Interface? Briefly explain how to define interface and implement in class. (7)

c. What is interface? How java support multiple interface with examples. (8)




c. Differentiate classes and interface with the syntax. (6)

a. Differentiate extends vs implements with respect to inheritance. Illustrate with a suitable example. (10)





c. What is an interface? Write a java program to implement stack operations using interface. (8)


b. Write a program to do basic operations on queue using interface. (10)



b. Write a Java program to create an interface Searchable with a method search() that searches an element in an array of integers. Create two classes Linear Search and Binary Search that implement the Searchable interface and provide their own implementations of the search() method. (8)

a. Demonstrate the usage of interface by creating an interface named shape and declare appropriate data members and abstract method to find the area. Implement this interface in three classes namely circle, triangle and square to compute the area. (8)


# Exception Handling: 

> Exception-Handling Fundamentals, Exception Types, Uncaught Exceptions Using try and catch, multiple catch Clauses, Nested try Statements, throw, throws, finally, Java's Built-in Exceptions, Creating Your Own Exception Subclasses.

## Exception-Handling Fundamentals, 

b. What is Exception? Demonstrate the working of nested try block with an example.(6)

a. What is an Exception? Explain try, catch, and finally block for exception handling. (8)

a. Write and explain the general form of exception-handling block. (6)


c. Explain the five keywords related to exception handling and write a program to implement all the keywords. (6)


## Exception Types, Uncaught Exceptions Using try and catch, 




## Multiple catch Clauses, Nested try Statements, 

b. Explain how the nested try statement works in Java? Give example. (7)

### throw, throws, finally, 

c. Differentiate Throw, Throws and finally in Java Exceptions. Give example. (8)


## Java's Built-in Exceptions, 

b. Explain any 4 built in exceptions with suitable examples. (6)

b. Illustrate how exceptions are used in java to handle runtime exceptions? Design a java program to demonstrate runtime exception called Index out of bound? (6)

a. Illustrate “catching an exception is programmatically good and necessary mechanism” with suitable examples. Design a java program to demonstrate Built in runtime exception. (10)

c. Write a program which should take one integer number as an input from user. The program should throw exception if the input number is greater than 20. (7)


## Creating Your Own Exception Subclasses.

b. How to create your own exceptions. Illustrate. (8)

b. Write a program to demonstrate user defined exception. (7)

a. Design a banking application where users can deposit and withdraw money. Create a custom exception InsufficientFundsException that is thrown when a withdrawal request exceeds the current balance. Demonstrate how to handle this custom exception using try-catch blocks and include a finally block to display the remaining balance after each transaction attempt.  (10)

b. Create exceptions called InvalidAgeException and ArrayOutOfBoundException. Write a Java program handles the appropriate exception gracefully based on the command line argument(s).

a. Illustrate how can you create your own exceptions with examples. Design an exception subclass which throws an exception if you try to withdraw the amount and balance is less than Rs.500. (6)

b. Write a program in Java to demonstrate the implementation of the custom exception type. The program should take a number as input from the user. If the number is greater than 10, it should throw an exception. (10)
