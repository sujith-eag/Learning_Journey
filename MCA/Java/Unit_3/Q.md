## Multithreaded Programming: 

> The Java Thread Model, The Main Thread, Creating a Thread, Creating Multiple Threads, Using isAlive() and join(), Thread Priorities, Synchronization, Inter-thread Communication, Suspending, Resuming, and Stopping Threads, Obtaining thread state, Using Multithreading.

With neat diagram explain the steps involved in life cycle of Thread.

Compare multiprocessing and multithreading. Bring out the
advantages of multithreading. Explain the Java Thread Model.

What is thread? Explain the difference between thread and process.

What is thread? Discuss methods that can be used in interthread
communication in Java.

Design a program to illustrate the different ways to create the thread &
explain the same.

What is the default priority of a thread, how to implement thread using Java? Give example.

Explain thread communication using notify(), wait() and notify All()
methods.

Describe the purpose of the methods: isAlive() and join(). with an example each.

Describe Thread Synchronization with an example.

How to achieve synchronization in multithread programming in Java.

Explain Synchronization. Write Java Code to demonstrate Thread
synchronization in Java.

Write a note on: i. synchronization, ii. synchronization methods
iii. synchronization statements.


Write a program to create two thread P1 and P2. Thread P1 shall print the odd numbers between 1 to 10 and thread P2 shall print even number between 11 to 20. The output shall be in ascending order.

Write a program in Java to create two threads ‘T1’ and ‘T2’. Thread
T1 should print the odd numbers between 1 to 10 and T2 should
print the even numbers between 1 to 10. The output of the program
should be in proper sequence (i.e. 1,2,3,….10).

Write a program to implement the producer and consumer using
Interthread Communication.


____
## Enumeration and Auto boxing: 

> Enumeration, Type Wrappers, Auto boxing.

Demonstrate enumeration as class type with suitable constant values.

Explain the concept of Type Wrappers with an example.

Why wrapper classes are required? Illustrate.

Discuss the methods: values() and valueOf() used in enumeration.

What is an enum? Write a java program to demonstrate values() and
valueOf() methods.

Write a JAVA Program to create an enumeration Day of Week with seven values SUNDAY through SATURDAY. Add a method is Workday( ) to the DayofWeek class that returns true if the value on which it is called is MONDAY through FRIDAY.
For example, the call DayOfWeek.SUNDAY.isWorkDay () returns false.

What is the application of Autoboxing/Unboxing? Explain with an
example.

___

## Generics: 

>What are Generics? A Simple Generics Example, A Generics Class with two Type Parameters, The General Form of a Generic Class.

Give the general form of a Generic Class. Illustrate with an example
using generics class for searching a given set of integer and floating
point numbers.

What are generics? Give an example of generics class with two Type
Parameters.

Explain the use of generics with an example program.

What is the purpose of using Generics? Develop a program using
generic class.
