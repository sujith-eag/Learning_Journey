b. What is JVM? What are its advantages? What is the difference between JDK and JVM? (6)

b. What is Platform independence? What makes Java Platform independent? Explain in detail. (6)

a. Can Java run on any machine? Justify. (6)

## Class Fundamentals, 

b. Explain the concept of Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. (7)

a. Explain the every words of the syntax?  `public static void main (string args[]).` (7)

## Declaring Objects, Assigning Object Reference Variables, 

a. What is Class? What is the difference between Class and Object? Give an example. (6)

a. What is the difference between class and object? How to define a class and create objects using Java? Give example. (8)




a. What are the access control supported by Java? Explain the different types of Javaâ€™s access modifiers. (10)

b. Illustrate the usage and effect of access control specifiers with respect to class members with an example. (8)


## Introducing Methods, Constructors, 

a. Define a constructor. Discuss its special properties? Explain how Constructors can be overloaded with the help of an example. (10)

c. What are the important properties of constructor? What are the advantage? Illustrate with an example. (8)



a. Create a Swapper class with two integer instance variables x and y and a constructor with two parameters that initialize the two variables. Also include three methods : A getX() method that returns x, and a getY() method that returns y, and a void swap() method that swaps the values of x and y. Then create a SwapperDemo class that tests all the methods. (10)


b. Given that Employee class contains the following members. Data members: emp_no, emp_name, basic, da, IT, Net_sal. Member functions: To initialize data, to calculate net salary and print data members. Write a java program to read the data and compute the net salary of each employee where DA=60% of basic pay and income tax 20 % if salary is less than 15,00000 or else 30%. (8)


## The this Keyword, Garbage, The finalize() Method, 

b. Discuss the use of this keyword. Write java program to find area of rectangle using command line arguments. (10)

b. What is Garbage Collection and what finalize () method does? Explain with an example. (6)


## Exploring the String Class,  Using Command-Line Arguments, 



## Varargs, Scanner class.


b. What are the advantages of using Varargs? Illustrate with an example. (8)

b. Illustrate with an example variable number of arguments. (6)

c. Discuss the usage of scanner class in Java. (6)
