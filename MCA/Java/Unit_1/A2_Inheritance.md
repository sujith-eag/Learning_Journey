## Inheritance Basics, 

>[!caution] Question
>a. What is inheritance? What are the advantages of inheritance? Give an example of inheritance using java. (8)


**Inheritance** is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java. It is the mechanism by which one class, known as the **subclass**, can acquire the properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) of another class, called the **superclass**. 

The `extends` keyword is used in Java to indicate that a class is inheriting from another. 

This process allows for the creation of hierarchical classifications, where a more specific class inherits traits from a more general class. A subclass is essentially a specialized version of its superclass and represents an "is-a" relationship (e.g., a `Dog` "is an" `Animal`).


**Advantages of Inheritance**: 
* Inheritance provides a natural way to express **hierarchical relationships** between classes. 
- A major advantage is **code reuse**, as the subclass automatically gets the members of its superclass, so they don't need to be redefined.
- This helps to **eliminate redundant code**.
- It **encourages code organization**.
* It promotes the "**is-a**" relationship, where a subclass is a type of its superclass (e.g., a `Dog` "is an" `Animal`).

**Example of Inheritance using Java**: The sources provide an example using `TwoDShape` as a superclass and `Triangle` as a subclass.

- The `TwoDShape` class defines generic attributes common to two-dimensional shapes, such as `width` and `height`.
- The `Triangle` class extends `TwoDShape` using the `extends` keyword.
- By extending `TwoDShape`, the `Triangle` class **inherits all members** defined by `TwoDShape`.
- The `Triangle` class can then add its own unique members, such as a `style` field and methods like `area()` and `showStyle()`.
- Because `Triangle` inherits `width` and `height`, it can directly access these inherited variables within its own methods, like `area()`.
- When an object of the `Triangle` class is created, it can refer to the inherited members (`width` and `height`) directly, as if they were declared within the `Triangle` class itself.

```java
// A superclass
class TwoDShape {
  double width;
  double height;

  void showDim() {
    System.out.println("Width and height are " 
	    + width + " and " + height);
  }
}

// A subclass of TwoDShape
class Triangle extends TwoDShape {
  String style;

  double area() {
    // Triangle can access width and height directly
    return width * height / 2;
  }

  void showStyle() {
    System.out.println("Triangle is " + style);
  }
}

class ShapeDemo {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Triangle t1 = new Triangle(); // Creates a Triangle object
    Triangle t2 = new Triangle(); // Creates another Triangle object

    // Set dimensions and style for t1
    t1.width = 4.0; // Accessing inherited member
    t1.height = 4.0; // Accessing inherited member
    t1.style = "isosceles"; // Accessing member unique to Triangle

    // Set dimensions and style for t2
    t2.width = 8.0; // Accessing inherited member
    t2.height = 12.0; // Accessing inherited member
    t2.style = "right"; // Accessing member unique to Triangle

    System.out.println("Info for t1: ");
    t1.showStyle(); // Using method unique to Triangle
    t1.showDim(); // Using inherited method from TwoDShape
    System.out.println("Area is " + t1.area()); // Using method unique to Triangle

    System.out.println(); // Print a blank line

    System.out.println("Info for t2: ");
    t2.showStyle(); // Using method unique to Triangle
    t2.showDim(); // Using inherited method from TwoDShape
    System.out.println("Area is " + t2.area()); // Using method unique to Triangle
  }
}
```

Access control is affected by modifiers like `public`, `private`, and `protected`, as well as package membership. 
Subclass includes all members of its superclass, it cannot access members that are declared `private` in the superclass.

When a subclass object is created, the constructor for the superclass is executed before the constructor for the subclass. If the superclass has a parameterized constructor, the subclass constructor must call a superclass constructor using `super()` as its first statement. If the superclass has no explicit constructor, Java provides a default one that is used.

>b. Illustrate inheritance with an example of private and default access. (6)


**Example of Inheritance Illustrating Default and Private Access**: 

Inheritance interacts with Java's access control mechanisms. Access modifiers like `public`, `private`, and `protected`, along with default access (when no modifier is used), determine the visibility of class members.

1. **Default Access**:
    
    - When a class member (variable or method) has **no explicit access modifier**, it is considered to have **default access**.
    - A member with default access is **visible within its package** but not outside its package.
    - In the context of inheritance, if a subclass and its superclass are in the **same package**, the subclass can directly access the default members of its superclass.
2. **Private Access**:
    
    - A member declared as **private** is the most restrictive; it is **accessible only by other members of its own class**.
    - **Inheriting a class does not grant access to its private members**. The private access restriction is not overruled by inheritance.
    - To allow code outside the superclass (including subclasses) to interact with private members, the superclass must provide **public** (or other suitably accessible) **accessor methods**.
The sources provide an example using a `TwoDShape` superclass and a `Triangle` subclass. We can use this to illustrate different access levels.

Let's first look at how the example implicitly demonstrates **default access**:

- In the source example, the `TwoDShape` class has `double width;` and `double height;` declared without any access modifier (like `public` or `private`).
- When a member has no explicit access modifier, it is said to have **default access**.
- A member with default access is **visible within its package but not outside its package**.
- Assuming the `TwoDShape` and `Triangle` classes (and the `ShapeDemo` class with `main`) are all in the same package, then `Triangle` can directly access the `width` and `height` instance variables from `TwoDShape`.

```java
// A superclass
class TwoDShape {
  double width;
  double height; 
  // Default access - accessible within the same package
  private double secretData; 
  // Private access - accessible only within TwoDShape class

  // Parameterised COnstructor
  TwoDShape(double w, double h) {
    width = w;
    height = h;

    this.secretData = w * h * 1.5; // Example calculation
  }

  // Default constructor
  TwoDShape() {
    width = 0.0;
    height = 0.0;
    this.secretData = 0.0;
  }

  // Default access method to show dimensions
  void showDim() 
  {
    System.out.println("Width and height are " 
	    + width + " and " + height);
  }

  // Default accessor method for private data
  double getSecretData() 
  {
    return secretData;
  }
}

// A subclass
class Triangle extends TwoDShape {
  String style; // Default access

  // Parameterized constructor
  Triangle(String s, double w, double h) {
    // Call the superclass constructor FIRST
    super(w, h);
    style = s;
  }

  // Default constructor
  Triangle() {
    super(); // Call the default superclass constructor
    style = "none";
  }

  // Method to calculate area
  double area() {
    // can directly access
    return width * height / 2;
  }

  // Method to show style
  void showStyle() {
    System.out.println("Triangle is " + style);
  }

  // Method to show inherited secret data
  void showInheritedSecretData() {
    System.out.println("Secret Data: " + secretData); 
    // This would cause a compile-time error
    // Cannot directly access private member
    
    // Using accessor method by the superclass
    System.out.println("Inherited Secret Data: " 
	    + getSecretData());
  }
}

// A class to demonstrate usage
class ShapeDemo {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    // Create Triangle objects using different constructors
    Triangle t1 = new Triangle("isosceles", 4.0, 4.0);
    Triangle t2 = new Triangle("right", 8.0, 12.0);
    Triangle t3 = new Triangle(); // Using default constructors

    System.out.println("Info for t1: ");
    t1.showStyle(); // Accessing method unique to Triangle

    System.out.println("t1.width: " + t1.width); // Direct access to inherited default member
    t1.showDim(); // Accessing inherited method with default access
    System.out.println("Area is " + t1.area()); 
    // Accessing method unique to Triangle (uses inherited default members)
    
    t1.showInheritedSecretData(); 
    // Accessing method unique to Triangle


    System.out.println("\nInfo for t2: ");
    t2.showStyle();
    t2.showDim();
    System.out.println("Area is " + t2.area());
    t2.showInheritedSecretData();

    System.out.println("\nInfo for t3: ");
    t3.showStyle();
    t3.showDim(); // Uses inherited default members (which got default values 0.0 from super() )
    System.out.println("Area is " + t3.area());
    t3.showInheritedSecretData(); // Uses inherited accessor for private data (which got default value 0.0 from super() )
  }
}
```

In this example:

- `TwoDShape` has `width` and `height` with **default access** and `secretData` with **private access**.
- The `Triangle` subclass is in the same package.
- Inside `Triangle`'s `area()` method, it **directly accesses** `width` and `height`, demonstrating that default members are accessible within the same package by a subclass.
- Inside `Triangle`'s `showInheritedSecretData()` method, attempting to directly access `secretData` is shown as an error. Instead, it must call the `getSecretData()` method (which has default access and is in the same package) defined in `TwoDShape` to retrieve the value of the private `secretData`.
- In `main`, objects of type `Triangle` (`t1`, `t2`, `t3`) can directly access inherited members with default access (`width`, `height`) and call inherited methods with default access (`showDim()`, `getSecretData()`) because `ShapeDemo` is also in the same package. This demonstrates the package-level visibility of default members.


```java
// A superclass (assuming default package, so members have default access)
class TwoDShape {
  double width; // Default access
  double height; // Default access

  void showDim() { // Default access
    System.out.println("Width and height are " + width + " and " + height);
  }
}

// A subclass in the same package (default package)
class Triangle extends TwoDShape {
  String style; // Default access unique to Triangle

  double area() {
    // Triangle can directly access width and height because they have default
    // access and Triangle is in the same package as TwoDShape.
    return width * height / 2;
  }

  void showStyle() { // Default access unique to Triangle
    System.out.println("Triangle is " + style);
  }
}

class ShapeDemo { // In the same package
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Triangle t1 = new Triangle();

    // Can access inherited members (width, height) directly because they
    // have default access and ShapeDemo is in the same package.
    t1.width = 4.0;
    t1.height = 4.0;
    t1.style = "isosceles";

    System.out.println("Info for t1: ");
    t1.showStyle();
    t1.showDim(); // Inherited method is also accessible
    System.out.println("Area is " + t1.area());
  }
}
```

In this scenario, because `TwoDShape` and `Triangle` are in the same package (the default package if no `package` statement is used), the `width` and `height` members (with default access) are fully accessible to `Triangle` and `ShapeDemo`.

Now, let's consider **private access** with inheritance:

- If the `width` and `height` members in the `TwoDShape` superclass were declared as `private`, they would only be accessible by other members **within the `TwoDShape` class itself**.
- **Inheriting a class does not overrule the private access restriction**. A subclass, like `Triangle`, would **not** be able to directly access the `private` members of its superclass, `TwoDShape`.
- To allow subclasses (or any other code outside the superclass) to interact with private members, the superclass must provide **public accessor methods** (like getter and setter methods).

```java
// A superclass with private members
class TwoDShape {
  private double width; // Private access
  private double height; // Private access

  // Public accessor methods to get the values
  double getWidth() { // Default access, assuming same package
    return width;
  }

  double getHeight() { // Default access, assuming same package
    return height;
  }

  // Methods to set the values (can add validation here)
  void setWidth(double w) { // Default access, assuming same package
    width = w;
  }

  void setHeight(double h) { // Default access, assuming same package
    height = h;
  }

  void showDim() { // Default access, assuming same package
    System.out.println("Width and height are " + width + " and " + height);
  }
}

// A subclass
class Triangle extends TwoDShape {
  String style;

  double area() {
    // ERROR: Cannot directly access private members width and height here!
    // return width * height / 2; // This would cause a compile-time error

    // Must use the public accessor methods inherited from TwoDShape
    return getWidth() * getHeight() / 2; // Correct way to access private data
  }

  void showStyle() {
    System.out.println("Triangle is " + style);
  }
}

class ShapeDemo { // In the same package
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Triangle t1 = new Triangle();

    // ERROR: Cannot directly access private members width and height here!
    // t1.width = 4.0; // This would cause a compile-time error

    // Must use the public methods inherited from TwoDShape
    t1.setWidth(4.0); // Correct way to set private data
    t1.setHeight(4.0); // Correct way to set private data

    t1.style = "isosceles";

    System.out.println("Info for t1: ");
    t1.showStyle();
    t1.showDim(); // Inherited method still works
    System.out.println("Area is " + t1.area());
  }
}
```

This second example illustrates the principle that private members of a superclass are hidden from subclasses, requiring public methods for controlled access, which is consistent with the encapsulation principle of OOP.
