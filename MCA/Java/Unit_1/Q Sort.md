a. Can Java run on any machine? Justify. (6)

## Class Fundamentals, 

b. Explain the concept of Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. (7)

a. Explain the every words of the syntax?  `public static void main (string args[]).` (7)

## Declaring Objects, Assigning Object Reference Variables, 

a. What is Class? What is the difference between Class and Object? Give an example. (6)

a. What is the difference between class and object? How to define a class and create objects using Java? Give example. (8)




a. What are the access control supported by Java? Explain the different types of Java’s access modifiers. (10)

b. Illustrate the usage and effect of access control specifiers with respect to class members with an example. (8)


## Introducing Methods, Constructors, 

a. Define a constructor. Discuss its special properties? Explain how Constructors can be overloaded with the help of an example. (10)

c. What are the important properties of constructor? What are the advantage? Illustrate with an example. (8)



a. Create a Swapper class with two integer instance variables x and y and a constructor with two parameters that initialize the two variables. Also include three methods : A getX() method that returns x, and a getY() method that returns y, and a void swap() method that swaps the values of x and y. Then create a SwapperDemo class that tests all the methods. (10)


b. Given that Employee class contains the following members. Data members: emp_no, emp_name, basic, da, IT, Net_sal. Member functions: To initialize data, to calculate net salary and print data members. Write a java program to read the data and compute the net salary of each employee where DA=60% of basic pay and income tax 20 % if salary is less than 15,00000 or else 30%. (8)


## The this Keyword, Garbage, The finalize() Method, 

b. Discuss the use of this keyword. Write java program to find area of rectangle using command line arguments. (10)

b. What is Garbage Collection and what finalize () method does? Explain with an example. (6)


## Exploring the String Class,  Using Command-Line Arguments, 



## Varargs, Scanner class.


b. What are the advantages of using Varargs? Illustrate with an example. (8)

b. Illustrate with an example variable number of arguments. (6)

c. Discuss the usage of scanner class in Java. (6)



# Inheritance: 

> Inheritance Basics, Using super, Creating a Multilevel Hierarchy, When Constructors Are Called, Method Overriding, Dynamic Method Dispatch, Using Abstract Classes, Using final with Inheritance, The Object Class.


## Inheritance Basics, 

a. What is inheritance? What are the advantages of inheritance? Give an example of inheritance using java. (8)


a. What is inheritance? Illustrate with an example of private and default access. (6)

## Using super, Creating a Multilevel Hierarchy, 

a. Describe the use of Super keyword in inheritance. Illustrate with an example. (6)

b. Illustrate with an example, how to invoke super class constructor from the subclass. (6)



c. What is inheritance? Explain the order of execution of constructor execution in multilevel hierarchy of classes. (6)


## When Constructors Are Called, Method Overriding, 


c. Illustrate with an example method overloading and method overriding. (8)
a. Explain the following with Java Code: i) Method overriding  ii) Method overloading. (10)

b. List the three rule of method overriding. How to achieve dynamic Polymorphism? Give example. (8)


## Dynamic Method Dispatch, 

b. What is Dynamic method dispatch? Illustrate with an example. (10)

c. What is runtime polymorphism is Java? Explain with example. (8)

## Using Abstract Classes, 

c. What is Abstract Class? Give example. (5)

b. Write syntax and use of the following: i) abstract class ii) final Keyword. (6)

c. Write a program that creates an abstract class ‘Shape’. Create sub classes rectangle and triangle, that include appropriate methods for both sub classes that calculate area of rectangle and triangle. (8)


## Using final with Inheritance, 

b. Illustrate with an example usage of final keyword with respect to inheritance? (6)

b. With the help of suitable examples, explain how "final" can be used to avoid Method overriding. (6)

## The Object Class.

a. Explain the following with Java Code wherever required: i) Varargs  ii) Object Class  iii) Use of final in inheritance   iv) super keyword. (10)
