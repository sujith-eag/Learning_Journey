## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Graph Structures in RSA ‚Äì Prime Factorization Graphs**

### **üîπ How RSA Works:**

- RSA encryption is based on the **difficulty of factoring large numbers** into primes.
- If you **multiply two large prime numbers `p` and `q`**, the result `N = p √ó q` is **easy to compute**.
- However, **finding `p` and `q` from `N`** (factoring) is extremely difficult for large numbers.

### **üîπ Graph Representation of RSA:**

RSA factorization can be visualized as a **graph traversal problem**, where:

- **Nodes (Vertices):** Represent numbers, including `N`, its prime factors, and divisors.
- **Edges:** Represent **factorization relationships** between numbers.

#### **Example: Prime Factorization as a Graph**

For `N = 2310`, the factorization graph is:

```
        2310
       /    \
     77      30
    /  \    /  \
   7   11  5   6
            /  \
           2    3
```

- Each **number is a node**, and **edges represent division**.
- **Finding prime factors is equivalent to traversing this graph**.
- Large numbers create a **massive graph**, making traversal (factoring) computationally hard.

#### **Graph-Based Attacks on RSA**

- **Graph traversal algorithms** like **Pollard‚Äôs Rho** and **GNFS (General Number Field Sieve)** attempt to **break RSA encryption** by efficiently traversing the factorization graph.
- **Shor‚Äôs Algorithm (Quantum Computing)** uses **graph-based quantum Fourier transforms** to break RSA **exponentially faster**.

‚úÖ **Why Graph Data Structures Matter in RSA?**

- **RSA security is based on the complexity of navigating the factorization graph**.
- **Graph algorithms help improve or attack RSA encryption**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Graph Structures in ECC ‚Äì Cyclic Groups of Points**

### **üîπ How ECC Works:**

- Instead of numbers, ECC operates on **points on an elliptic curve** defined by: y2=x3+ax+by^2 = x^3 + ax + b
- The core operation is **point addition**, where adding two points `P` and `Q` on the curve gives another point `R`.
- ECC encryption is based on the **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**:  
    **Given `G` and `Q = kG`, finding `k` is extremely hard**.

### **üîπ Graph Representation of ECC:**

ECC encryption **forms a cyclic graph structure**:

- **Nodes (Vertices):** Represent **valid points** on the elliptic curve.
- **Edges:** Represent **point addition operations** (`P + Q = R`).

#### **Example: Cyclic Graph of ECC Points**

For a **small** elliptic curve, the graph might look like:

```
   P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Pn ‚Üí P1  (Cycle)
```

- This **cyclic graph** represents **point addition operations**.
- Breaking ECC requires **traversing this graph backwards** (which is hard).

#### **Graph-Based Attacks on ECC**

- **Baby-step Giant-step Algorithm**: Uses **graph traversal techniques** to solve `k` in `Q = kG`.
- **Quantum Attacks**: Shor‚Äôs Algorithm **also applies to ECC**, but ECC is harder to break than RSA due to its **graph complexity**.

‚úÖ **Why Graph Data Structures Matter in ECC?**

- ECC operates on a **cyclic graph** of points.
- **Graph-based problems make breaking ECC computationally expensive**.
