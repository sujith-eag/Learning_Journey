## Packet Switching

### Introduction to Packet Switching

Packet switching is the fundamental communication model used in the Internet. It allows messages from source end systems to be divided into smaller units called **packets**, which are then transmitted independently over a network to the destination end system.

Key characteristics:

- Large messages are broken into **packets**.
    
- Each packet typically includes:
    
    - A **header** (with destination address, sequence number, etc.)
        
    - A **payload** (a segment of the original message)
        
- Packets travel independently through a network of communication links and **packet switches** (typically routers or link-layer switches).
    
- The time to transmit a packet of **L** bits over a link with transmission rate **R** is `L/R` seconds.

## Store and Forward

In **store-and-forward transmission**, used in packet-switched networks, a router must receive an entire packet before forwarding it to the next node.

- This introduces a **delay at each hop**.
    
- For a packet of **L bits** over a link with **R bits/sec**, transmission time per link is `L/R` seconds.
    
- A router adds **2L/R seconds** delay (receive + forward).
    
- In a pipeline of multiple packets, if three packets are sent back-to-back, the final one arrives at `4L/R` seconds.
    
- For **N links** (and N−1 routers), the end-to-end delay is `NL/R`.
    

This mechanism ensures reliable, orderly packet delivery.

## Queuing Delays and Packet Loss

In packet-switched networks, **output buffers** (queues) are present for each router’s outgoing link.

- If the link is busy, arriving packets are **queued**, introducing **queuing delay**.
    
- Delay varies with **network congestion**.
    
- If the buffer is full when a new packet arrives, **packet loss** occurs. The arriving packet may be dropped or an older one discarded.

- Common during high traffic or **bursty transmissions** which exceeds the links capacity.
    
- Example: Two hosts sending data over a shared 1.5 Mbps link may congest the router.
    

Analogy: Like waiting in line at a bank or tollbooth—the more crowded, the longer the wait or risk of being turned away.

## Circuit Switching

Circuit switching is another fundamental method for transmitting data, used alongside packet switching.

- A **dedicated path** with reserved resources (bandwidth, buffers) is set up for the entire communication session.
    
- Once the circuit is established, transmission occurs at a **constant rate**.
    
- Traditional telephone networks are based on circuit switching.
    
    - Each call sets up a **fixed-rate connection** across intermediate switches.
        
    - For example, with 1 Mbps links divided into 4 circuits, each gets **250 kbps**.
        

This method ensures **reliability** and **predictability**, but can be **inefficient** when resources are unused during silence or inactivity.

### Three Phases of Circuit Switching:

1. Connection Establishment
    
2. Data Transfer
    
3. Connection Teardown (Disconnection)

## Multiplexing in Circuit-Switched Networks

Circuit-switched links can carry multiple connections using **multiplexing**:

### 1. Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM)

- The frequency spectrum is split into bands.
    
- Each connection gets a **dedicated frequency band**.
    
- Used in traditional phone systems (4 kHz per voice call), FM radio (88–108 MHz).
    

### 2. Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)

- Time is divided into **frames**; each frame is split into **time slots**.
    
- Each connection gets a fixed time slot per frame.
    
- Example: 8,000 frames/sec × 8 bits = **64 kbps per circuit**.
A link transmitting 8,000 frames/second, each time slot(second) carries 8 bits, then a single circuit provides 64 kbps.    

### Drawbacks of Circuit Switching:

- **Resource underutilization** during idle periods (e.g., silence in calls).
    
- **Complex signaling** required to set up and maintain dedicated circuits.
Circuit switching can be wasteful, as reserved resources (like time slots or frequency bands) remain
idle during silence or inactivity.
–Example: In a voice call or a radiologist’s session, when there’s no data transfer (e.g., during pauses),
the allocated bandwidth goes unused.
–Also, setting up and managing dedicated circuits requires complex control signaling.

## Network of Networks

The Internet is a **network of networks**, where multiple types of **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** interconnect to form the global infrastructure.

### Hierarchical Internet Structure:

- **Access ISPs**:
    
    - Connect end users (e.g., homes, businesses, universities) to the Internet.
        
    - Cannot directly connect to every ISP worldwide.
        
- **Regional ISPs**:
    
    - Aggregate traffic from multiple access ISPs within a geographic region.
        
    - Provide a bridge between access ISPs and Tier-1 networks.
        
- **IXPs (Internet Exchange Points)**:
    
    - Neutral facilities where ISPs exchange traffic (peering).
        
    - Reduce **latency** and **costs** by enabling direct peering.
        
- **Tier-1 ISPs (Global Transit Providers)**:
    
    - Core backbone of the Internet.
        
    - Peer with each other and offer **global routing**.
        
    - Examples: Level 3 (now Lumen), AT&T, NTT.

## Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks

As a packet travels through a network, it encounters multiple types of **delays** at each node (router):

### 1. Processing Delay

- Time to inspect packet header and perform error checking.
    
- Typically a few microseconds.
    

### 2. Queuing Delay

- Time spent in the router’s queue before being transmitted.
    
- Depends on traffic intensity; can vary from microseconds to milliseconds.
    

### 3. Transmission Delay

- Time to push all packet bits onto the link.
    
- `Transmission delay = L / R`
    
    - L = packet length (bits)
        
    - R = transmission rate (bps)
        

### 4. Propagation Delay

- Time for the bits to travel across the link.
    
- `Propagation delay = d / s`
    
    - d = distance
        
    - s = propagation speed (typically 2×10⁸ to 3×10⁸ m/s)
        

**Total nodal delay**:  
`d_nodal = d_proc + d_queue + d_trans + d_prop`

---

## Queuing Delay and Traffic Intensity

**Queuing delay** is the most complex and variable delay component and depends on **traffic intensity**:

- `Traffic intensity = La / R`
    
    - L = packet length (bits)
        
    - a = average arrival rate (packets/sec)
        
    - R = link transmission rate (bps)
        

As **La/R** approaches 1, queuing delays increase rapidly and can lead to **packet loss**.

Unlike other delays (processing, transmission, propagation), queuing delay changes for each packet based on network traffic conditions.
For example, when multiple packets arrive simultaneously, the first may experience no delay, while others wait their turn.


---

## Packet Loss

In real networks, queues have limited capacity unlike the theoretical assumption of infinite
queues. When a packet arrives and the queue is full, the router drops the packet, causing
packet loss.

Packet loss occurs when a packet cannot be queued due to full buffer space.
–As traffic intensity (La/R) increases, the chance of packet loss also increases.
–Instead of infinite delay (as in theory), real routers drop excess packets.
–From the end-system’s perspective, a lost packet looks like it disappeared in the
network.
–Packet loss is a key metric along with delay when measuring node performance.
–In many protocols (like TCP), lost packets are retransmitted to ensure reliable
delivery.

- Routers have **limited buffer space**.
    
- When the queue is full, arriving packets are **dropped**.
    
- High **traffic intensity (La/R)** increases the chance of packet loss.
    

Implications:

- From the sender’s perspective, a lost packet "disappears".
    
- **Reliable protocols** like TCP detect and **retransmit** lost packets.

## End-to-End Delay

**Nodal delay** occurs at a single router.  
**End-to-end delay** is the **total time** a packet takes to reach from **source to destination**, across all routers.

### Assumptions (Simplified Model):

- N total nodes (N−1 routers).
    
- No congestion (ignore queuing delay).
    
- Equal packet size **L**, transmission rate **R**, and delay components.
    

### Formula:

- `d_end-to-end = N × (d_proc + d_trans + d_prop)`
    
    - `d_trans = L / R`

## Jitter in Computer Networks

**Jitter** refers to **variability in packet delay** between successive packets.

- Important in **real-time applications** like VoIP, gaming, and video conferencing.
    
- High jitter results in **out-of-order delivery** and poor user experience.

## Transmission Modes

Communication between two devices can occur in one of three modes:

1. **Simplex**
    
    - Data flows in **one direction only**.
        
    - Example: **Television broadcast**
        
2. **Half-Duplex**
    
    - Data flows in **both directions**, but **only one direction at a time**.
        
    - Example: **Walkie-talkies**, **police radios**
        
3. **Full-Duplex**
    
    - Data flows in **both directions simultaneously**.
        
    - Example: **Telephone conversations**


Layered Architecture

Layered architecture is an approach where complex systems are broken down into multiple, manageable
layers.
Each layer handles a well-defined task and provides services to the layer above while using services
from the layer below.
This architectural model is widely used in networking and software systems to simplify design and
promote flexibility.
Purpose:
–To create modularity, allowing easier design, implementation, and maintenance.
–To standardize communication, enabling interoperability among different devices and
technologies.
–To support abstraction, where each layer hides internal details and exposes only necessary
interfaces.
–To simplify troubleshooting and debugging by isolating issues within specific layers.
–To allow easy upgrades or changes to individual layers without affecting the entire system.


Reference Model

OSI Reference Model:

●Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
●OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection.
●Although rarely used in practice today, it remains a general and conceptually important model.
●The features discussed at each layer are still highly relevant.
●The OSI model is not a network architecture; it does not define specific protocols or services at
each layer.
●Instead, it serves as a theoretical framework for understanding network functionality.

TCP/IP Reference Model:
●TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol.
●Developed by ARPANET, the predecessor to the modern Internet.
●It is a practical and widely used model, forming the basis of the Internet today.
●Unlike the OSI model, TCP/IP defines actual protocols used at each layer, making it more
suitable for real-world implementations.
