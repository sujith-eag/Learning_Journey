Data Structures - Definition
Data structures are a way of arranging or organizing data to make accessing, retrieving and actions on data more efficient.

Functions
Sorting, accessing, modifying, updating, arranging, removing, adding, traversing

Types - Primitive and non-primitive data types

Primitive data structures are those that can store only one value in it.
int, float, char, double
(size of int in c, c++, java are 4 bytes, 16 bits. float are 8 bytes) 
(In python the size of int is dependent on the size of memory the system can provide)

Non primitive are those that can store multiple values in it.
linked list, arrays, trees, maps, heaps.
