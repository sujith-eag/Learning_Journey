a Function to create a new node
Allocating memory for the node using `malloc()` with the size of the node data structure passed 
The void pointer returned by malloc is type casted into the node data type and assigned to the new pointer.
For the first addition, the head is also made to point to the same node as new.
The previous value of the temp is stored as pointer inside the node data type using dot or arrow notation.
then the value of temp is updated to point to new pointer.

Three pointers to the node, one for new created one, another for temporary holding of value, another to point to the head of the list marking the first node.
