# 11 Container with most water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

Constraints:
    n == height.length
    2 <= n <= 105
    0 <= height[i] <= 104
```

```c
# 1679 Max number of K sum pairs

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.
In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.
Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.

Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 105
    1 <= nums[i] <= 109
    1 <= k <= 109  
```

```c
# Sort Characters By Frequency 451
Given a string `s`, sort it in **decreasing order** based on the **frequency** of the characters. The **frequency** of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return _the sorted string_. If there are multiple answers, return _any of them_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "tree"
**Output:** "eert"
**Explanation:** 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "cccaaa"
**Output:** "aaaccc"
**Explanation:** Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "Aabb"
**Output:** "bbAa"
**Explanation:** "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

```c
# First Unique character in a string

Given a string `s`, _find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index_. If it does not exist, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "leetcode"
**Output:** 0

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "loveleetcode"
**Output:** 2

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "aabb"
**Output:** -1
```
