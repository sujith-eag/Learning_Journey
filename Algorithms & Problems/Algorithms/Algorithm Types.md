Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem or accomplishing a task in programming. They are fundamental to computer science and are used to manipulate data and perform calculations. Algorithms can vary widely in complexity and purpose. Here are the main types and categories of algorithms commonly used in programming:

### Types of Algorithms:

1. **Search Algorithms**:
   - **[[1_Linear_Search|Linear Search]]**: Sequentially checks each element of a list until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.
   - **[[2_Binary_Search|Binary Search]]**: Efficiently searches a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

2. **Sort Algorithms**:
   - **[[1 Selection Sort|Selection Sort]]**
   - **[[2 Insertion Sort|Insertion Sort]]**
   - **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
   - **[[3 Merge Sort|Merge Sort]]**: Divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.
   - **[[4 Quick Sort|Quick Sort]]**: Chooses a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot, recursively sorting each sub-array.


3. **Recursive Algorithms**:
   - Algorithms that solve a problem by calling itself recursively, typically involving a base case and a recursive case.
   - Examples include factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence generation, and tree traversal algorithms.

4. **Dynamic Programming Algorithms**:
   - Breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations.
   - Examples include the knapsack problem, Fibonacci sequence with memoization, and shortest path algorithms.

5. **Greedy Algorithms**:
   - Makes a sequence of choices that are locally optimal at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.
   - Examples include Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path and Huffman coding for data compression.

6. **Graph Algorithms**:
   - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traverses a graph deeply before backtracking.
   - **[[BFS|Breadth-First Search (BFS)]]**: Explores neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
   - **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Finds a subset of the edges that connects all the vertices together without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

7. **String Algorithms**:
   - **String Matching**: Algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) and Boyer-Moore for finding occurrences of a pattern within a text.
   - **String Compression**: Techniques like Run-Length Encoding (RLE) to compress repetitive sequences in a string.

8. **Numerical Algorithms**:
   - **Numerical Integration**: Techniques like Simpson's rule or Trapezoidal rule for approximating the integral of a function.
   - **Linear Algebra**: Algorithms for solving systems of linear equations, matrix operations, and eigenvalue problems.

9. **Encryption and Cryptographic Algorithms**:
   - **Symmetric Encryption**: Algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for secure communication.
   - **Public Key Cryptography**: Algorithms like RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) for secure data transmission and digital signatures.

### Categories of Algorithms:

- **Deterministic Algorithms**: Produce the same output for a given input every time they run.
- **Randomized Algorithms**: Use randomness to make decisions during execution.
- **Approximation Algorithms**: Find approximate solutions to optimization problems when finding an exact solution is impractical.
- **Parallel Algorithms**: Execute multiple instructions simultaneously to solve a problem faster.
- **Online Algorithms**: Process data as it arrives, making decisions without having all the data available.

### Choosing the Right Algorithm:

- **Complexity**: Consider the time complexity (how long it takes to run) and space complexity (how much memory it uses).
- **Problem Constraints**: Some algorithms are better suited for specific data types (e.g., arrays vs. linked lists) or problem sizes.
- **Performance**: Evaluate based on the expected input size and performance requirements (e.g., real-time vs. batch processing).

In programming, understanding different types of algorithms and when to apply them is crucial for efficiently solving problems and optimizing software performance. Each algorithm type has its strengths and weaknesses, making it essential to choose the most appropriate algorithm for the task at hand.
